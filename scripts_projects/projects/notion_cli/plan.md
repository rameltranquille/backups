# Notion CLI Project Plan

**Goal: Create a command line version of notion for linux, written in C++. The
CLI version should be able to create and handle different types of lists,
pages, etc. (tables may be muc hharder to implement)**

## Questions
1. How do we communicate with the API using C++ 
2. What are the capabilities of the notion API? Will I be able to easily create commands
