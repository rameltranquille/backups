The companies, which provide road and sea-cargo handling machinery and services to industries, factories, ports and terminals, announced the deal in October last year but subsequently faced opposition from the European Commission. Konecranes and Cargotec last month offered to sell assets to address the EU competition enforcer’s concerns that the merger may curb competition and push up prices.</p>

Aeromexico, which filed for bankruptcy in June 2020 as demand cratered in the first months of the pandemic, won final court approval for a restructuring plan that aims to reduce its debt from $2 billion to more than $1 billion. But even after slashing its debt load and operating costs under Chapter 11 protection, Aeromexico may struggle to claw back ground lost to low-cost carriers.</p>

Qatar has also requested an EU resolution to a 2018 probe into its long-term contracts, which the European Commission had said might be inhibiting the free flows of gas in Europe and its single gas market. The requests made by Qatar go to the core of the EU&#8217;s gas market liberalization. The EU sees totally free trade of gas as essential to energy security, but major producers and some gas consumers say the reforms of the past two decades have often wreaked havoc and led to higher prices.</p>
