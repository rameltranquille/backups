Thales, which ranks as Europe&#8217;s largest defense electronics company, and its adviser Centerview Partners, have approached several private equity firms, including Bain Capital, to study a joint offer for Atos, which issued two profit warnings in seven months. Any deal involving buyout funds would likely trigger a break-up of Atos and raise political concern ahead of France’s presidential election in April. <strong>Shares in Atos jumped 10% on the news, while Thales’ stock was down 3%.</strong></p>

By 2030, the alliance is expected to come up with more than 30 new battery EVs underpinned by five common platforms, including a new platform for compact EVs designed by Renault.</p>

If regulators ultimately decide to block transactions between American firms and Alibaba Cloud, it will damage the bottom line of one of the company&#8217;s most promising businesses and deal a blow to reputation of the company as a whole.</p>

While investors were wowed when Chief Executive Kenichiro Yoshida told a Las Vegas tech fair the company was setting up Sony Mobility, its stock fell 7% as they contemplated the challenge of delivering EVs packed with sensors, consumer electronics and entertainment offerings. The primary goal of Sony-branded cars, analysts say, is to create an autonomous connected vehicle for services such as car sharing and ride hailing, which could eventually outstrip automobile sales. </p>

In the letter, the German police asked Binance to provide data relating to the pair, including all digital currency transactions.
