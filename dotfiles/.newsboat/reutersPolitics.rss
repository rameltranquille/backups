The officials, from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, strongly criticized the companies and said their inaction on fake news was forcing the Indian government to order content takedowns, which in turn drew international criticism that authorities were suppressing free expression.&nbsp;</p>

Qatar has also requested an EU resolution to a 2018 probe into its long-term contracts, which the European Commission had said might be inhibiting the free flows of gas in Europe and its single gas market. The requests made by Qatar go to the core of the EU&#8217;s gas market liberalization. The EU sees totally free trade of gas as essential to energy security, but major producers and some gas consumers say the reforms of the past two decades have often wreaked havoc and led to higher prices.</p>

The new figures come as an expert panel urges Congress to overhaul diabetes care and prevention, including recommendations to move beyond a reliance on medical interventions alone. A report released earlier this month calls for far broader policy changes to stem the diabetes epidemic, such as promoting consumption of healthier foods, ensuring paid maternal leave from the workplace, levying taxes on sugary drinks and expanding access to affordable housing, among other areas.</p>

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman is due to unveil the 2022/2023 federal budget on Feb. 1. Officials said the thinking was that sharp cuts in government expenditure could hurt growth prospects. India&#8217;s case load of coronavirus infections is surging, fueled by the Omicron variant and the worry is that consumer and business spending will be hit, leaving the government with little choice but to step in. </p>
