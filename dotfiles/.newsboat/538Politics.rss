<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2020 election, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rightward shift among Latino voters</a> raised eyebrows. <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-election surveys</a> have disagreed about <a href="https://twitter.com/A_agadjanian/status/1385639388818788355?s=20&amp;t=FfUIkI1qjxs8eHqCV2e3fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exact split</a> in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Latino vote</a>, but it appears around 3 in 5 (or slightly more) voted for President Biden over then-President Donald Trump. Yet many of those same surveys as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/20/us/politics/election-hispanics-asians-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precinct-level analysis</a> of the 2020 vote suggest that, compared with his performance in 2016, Trump made gains among Latinos — and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/13/south-texas-voters-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in some places</a>, quite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/21/us/miami-hispanic-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable ones</a>. Going forward, such swings among Latinos — <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest ethnic or racial minority group in the country</a> — could affect each party’s chance of carrying important states like Arizona, Florida and Texas while also putting Democratic-leaning turf <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in play for the GOP</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet for all the talk about Republicans making serious inroads with Latino voters, new data from Gallup suggests that Latinos’ lurch toward the GOP could be overstated, at least when it comes to how they identify with the two major parties. In Gallup’s survey data for 2021, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pollster found</a> that 56 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as Democrats or as independents who leaned toward the Democratic Party, while 26 percent identified as Republican or as leaning toward the GOP. Those figures represent very little change from what Gallup found in 2020 and, as the chart below shows, largely fall in line with Hispanic party-identification data over the past decade.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="Latinos continue to identify more as Democrats" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-EvCJJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EvCJJ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been really only one inflection point in Gallup’s Hispanic party-ID data, which came around 2015 and 2016, when the share of Hispanics identifying with the Democratic Party shot up to 62 percent, while the share identifying with the Republican Party fell below 30 percent. Perhaps not coincidentally, this coincided with Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, which was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-klinker-immigration-election-20170417-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly nativist</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-worries-rise-amid-hostile-trump-comments-on-latinos-and-muslims/2016/06/05/986545e8-2a1c-11e6-a3c4-0724e8e24f3f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hostile toward Latinos</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, those changes didn’t necessarily produce a big shift in electoral fortunes. In fact, in 2016, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-probably-did-better-with-latino-voters-than-romney-did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump probably performed better</a> with the Latino electorate than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had four years earlier. That’s partly because shifts in party ID may not actually be all that predictive of how Latino voters will ultimately vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Latinos are pretty swingy compared with other voting blocs, as they’re just not that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912919888577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attached to the two major parties</a>. Case in point: In Gallup’s 2021 polling, 52 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as independent, which was 10 percentage points higher <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the population as a whole</a> (42 percent). And when asked if they leaned toward one party, Latino independents were more likely to identify with the Democratic Party. But since most Latino Americans first identified as independent, this means that of the 56 percent who identified as or leaned Democratic, around two in five were actually independent leaners. (Among Republicans, almost three in five were independent leaners.) And while studies show that voters leaning toward a party do tend to back that party, <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.649.1442&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they are still more likely</a> to vote for the other side than voters who strongly identify with a party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And among Latinos, ties to the two parties may be particularly weak because they aren’t as likely as other Americans to form a strong partisan identity at a young age. For starters, about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/09/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third of Latinos weren't born in the U.S.</a>, which means many haven't developed a strong allegiance to either party. As a result, many first-generation Latinos <a href="https://www.robertofcarlos.com/uploads/6/9/4/3/69439129/late_to_the_party_on_the_prolonged_partisan_socialization_process_of_secondgeneration_americans.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven't instilled loyalty to either party</a> in their children, which is often how younger voters in the U.S. form their partisan identities.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the various forces described here also affect other immigrant populations in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a> It’s no surprise then that younger Latinos, in particular, hold only weak affinities for the two major parties or identify as independent, as they often have to find their own way politically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These looser partisan attachments mean that a sizable bloc of the Latino electorate is persuadable. This was <a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/2020-post-mortem-part-one-16221adbd2f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the takeaways</a> from Equis Research’s post-mortem on the 2020 election, which found that <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/60668f2a28dee76b4ffebc73/1617334072783/Equis+Post-Mortem+Part+One+%28Public+Deck%29+%281%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump won over many Democratic-leaning Latino voters</a>. This was true both in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily Hispanic South Texas</a>, where the Democratic margin shrunk from 33 points in 2016 to just 17 points in 2020,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the vote totals in 28 counties along or near Texas&rsquo;s border with Mexico: Brewster, Brooks, Cameron, Culberson, Dimmit, Duval, El Paso, Frio, Hidalgo, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kinney, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Presidio, Reeves, Starr, Terrell, Val Verde, Webb, Willacy, Zapata and Zavala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> and in Nevada, where 11 percent of Latino voters in Trump’s coalition had backed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to Equis’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/post-mortem-part-two-the-american-dream-voter-66dd6f673d1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The analysis</a> from the Latino-focused research outfit pointed to Latino approval of Trump’s economic policies <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/61b7e8e75c74f5558036268b/1639442667560/Post-Mortem+Part+Two+FINAL+Dec+13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a key factor</a> that helped Trump win over Latino voters worried about how COVID-19 would impact the economy. And because concerns about COVID-19 and the economy dominated the spotlight, immigration issues that might have kept some Latinos from backing Trump became less salient. That was important because Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-Latino rhetoric had kept some more conservative-leaning Latinos from voting for him in 2016, but with immigration pushed to the background in 2020, these voters now felt more comfortable casting a ballot for Trump. Additionally, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/latino-voters-moved-to-trump-because-of-covid-and-socialism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP attempts to label Democrats</a> as “socialists” likely contributed to these shifts as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, how Latinos voted in 2020 may also not square with Gallup’s party-affiliation data because Latinos are less likely to vote than other major racial and ethnic groups. In 2020, 54 percent of voting-eligible Latinos cast a ballot, <a href="https://clacls.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/7199/files/2021/05/Laird-W.-Bergad-and-Luis-A.-Miranda-Latino-Voter-Registration-and-Participation-Rates-in-the-2020-Election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to data</a> compiled by the Center for Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino Studies at City University of New York, and while this was the highest turnout mark for Latinos on record, it still lagged well behind Asian Americans (60 percent), Black Americans (63 percent) and white Americans (71 percent).&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, understanding which Latinos voted in 2020 is incredibly important. Equis found, for instance, that lower-propensity voters, many of whom were young, were less likely to have negative views of Trump than high-propensity voters, and that many ultimately backed Trump. For example, 17 percent of the Latino voters who backed Trump in Nevada in 2020 didn’t vote in 2016. Moreover, according to Equis, even though many younger Latino voters (those under the age of 50) had negative opinions of Trump, his standing among them improved by the fall of 2020. This means that as Latino voter turnout surged, especially among 18- to 44-year-olds (i.e., 60 percent of eligible Latino voters, per CUNY’s data), Trump stood to gain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What does all this mean for Latinos’ party preferences looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections? In short, despite the continued Democratic edge in party ID, there’s potential for the GOP to win over more persuadable Latino voters this November. Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has fallen especially hard</a> among Latinos, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-the-national-economy-assessments-of-prices-jobs-housing-and-the-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like other</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/i8sxn720xf/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans</a>, Latinos <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-crime-latinos-c9b99c24-d495-48ae-9366-b39e619c99ef.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are particularly worried</a> about issues like the economy, COVID-19 and crime, which could benefit Republicans, especially if immigration, an issue that <a href="https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy01.its.virginia.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912919844327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefited Democrats</a> among Latinos, remains mostly sidelined.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a Democrat in the White House, we’d also expect Republican-leaning Latinos <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be more likely to vote</a> in a midterm. Biden’s flagging numbers may also cost Democrats support from some Latinos in the middle, as well as depress turnout among Democratic-leaning Latinos. Recent generic-ballot polling, though, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/npwlx2cq4r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally finds</a> <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08222920/2202029_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats leading</a> among Latinos, although the <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-b883-d713-a1ff-fbabf09c0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">margins have varied</a> in ways <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/January-16-19-2022_Topline-Tables_January-23-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that could portend</a> a narrower gap between the parties. (In most cases, though, we’re relying on small samples of Latino voters within polls, so remember that means <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger margins of error</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, at this point it seems more likely than not that Latino voters will continue to prefer Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections. However, given the 2020 election results, the prominent issues that voters are worried about and Biden’s standing with the public, there’s plenty of reason to think that Republicans can further trim Democrats’ lead among Latino voters in 2022 — even if Democrats retain a sizable party-ID advantage among all Latinos.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Interested in who’s going to win the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Ohio in a few months? Well, we’ve got good news and bad news for you. The good news is that there are already 22 polls of the race! But the bad news is that 21 of them are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Internal polls are polls sponsored by either a candidate running in the race or an outside group that has endorsed one of the candidates. In other words, these are polls that have an agenda behind them — and that agenda is usually to make their preferred candidate look good. As a result, they are usually too good to be true for their sponsor. FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in 2017</a> that internal and partisan polls conducted during the last three weeks of U.S. House general elections overstated their party’s candidate by an average of 4 or 5 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This poses a serious problem for people (like us) just trying to get an honest read of a race — especially if internal polls are all (or most) of what we have to go off. And unfortunately, that’s not just the case in Ohio this year; it’s true in primaries nationwide. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We hunted down every poll we could find of 2022’s Senate, House and governor primaries (as of Feb. 10 at 3 p.m. Eastern), and a majority of them (at least 118 out of 229) are internal polls. And while we have polling data for a healthy 78 primaries so far (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s good</a>), that polling is 100 percent internal in 23 of those primaries (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s bad</a>).</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For an example of how internal polls can mislead, look no further than that Ohio Senate race. The Republican primary is a crowded affair with tons of undecided voters, creating an opportunity for several candidates to claim they’re doing well. For example, the campaign of former state Treasurer Josh Mandel recently released a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMandelOhio/status/1488960353115557892?s=20&amp;t=i5bdn_zQDgv1e-zqvGlFHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPA Intelligence poll</a> that gave himself 28 percent and businessman Mike Gibbons 17 percent. But a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1488636017775104000?s=20&amp;t=gu_Uv7h-MDs-ZAobqvz5iA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cygnal poll</a> conducted for Gibbons around the same time put Gibbons at 16 percent and Mandel at only 13 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in early January, a <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneTimkenOH/status/1479426941971218433?s=20&amp;t=zGwbEHe1WPt8przQrAeHUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Information Group survey</a> for former Ohio GOP Chair Jane Timken trumpeted that Timken was “statistically tied” with Mandel, 16 percent to 18 percent. And back in October, a <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1451212523873751042?s=20&amp;t=hXHa4vxgB-J7w3za5PRC6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio Lee poll</a> for a super PAC supporting author J.D. Vance similarly put Vance (16 percent) in a strong second place behind Mandel (19 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, these polls are all telling their own stories. But that doesn’t mean they’re totally useless. For instance, the fact that Mandel leads in even a couple of his opponents’ polls suggests that he is a front-runner. (The <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TRF-OH-22-GOP-Primary-1216-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only independent poll</a> of the race, conducted in December by the Trafalgar Group, concurs: It showed Mandel at 21 percent, Vance at 15 percent, Gibbons at 12 percent and Timken at 10 percent.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, internal polls’ trendlines can often be useful. For instance, in <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-d5b6-de19-a97e-f5b7f15e0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two Fabrizio Lee polls</a> since October, Vance has slumped to 10 percent and 9 percent, suggesting he is losing support over time. (In fact, it’s likely that these polls were released not to convince the public that Vance is doing well, but to convince <em>Vance</em> that his campaign needs to step it up.) Same with Mandel, whose own campaign’s polling staked him to an even bigger lead <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6096c989138a4a7ae28a2583/t/615130ca2389bb2832f7a74a/1632710859094/Ohio+Senate+Poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in September</a> (37 percent to Vance’s 13 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Ohio, we don’t have a lot of independent polling to validate those internal polls. But when we do, it can be a useful reality check. Take this year’s Republican primary for Texas governor. According to a <a href="https://www.paradigm-llp.com/_files/ugd/2d9332_4cdc2c9131514e6588ee56d58fae71b5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> by Paradigm Partners on behalf of former Texas GOP Chair Allen West’s campaign, West leads incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott, 43 percent to 34 percent. But two independent polls taken around the same time (one from the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/555718826/The-Dallas-Morning-News-University-of-Texas-Tyler-Poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler/Dallas Morning News</a> and one from <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/University of Houston</a>) put Abbott way ahead with 58-59 percent, while West is way back at 6-11 percent. That’s such a big disagreement that we reached out to Paradigm Partners to ask more about their methodology, and it turns out there’s a reason their poll is such a big outlier: While most polls are weighted to ensure they are demographically representative of the electorate, their survey was completely unweighted. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So you can see why it’s a problem that internal polls are such a large share of the primary polling data we have so far. And in fact, that problem may be understated. While we did our best to identify every internal poll so far this cycle, that “118” number is almost certainly an undercount. Just because we didn’t mark a poll as internal doesn’t mean it’s truly independent and unbiased. For instance, according to the New York Post, this <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/28/hochul-holds-solid-lead-over-james-in-ny-governor-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the Field Global poll</a> of the Democratic primary for governor of New York was paid for by an unknown “moderate political group” — hardly an uninterested actor in a race that looks like it will be another proxy war between Democrats’ moderate and progressive wings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the more unusual cases we identified is a quartet of <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21196588-ohio-poll-toplines-222?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling</a> surveys of <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/02/03/poll-trumps-endorsement-could-sway-gop-voters-toward-cox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican primaries</a> sponsored by the <em>Democratic</em> Governors Association. These aren’t internal polls because the DGA certainly isn’t endorsing GOP candidates — but they’re clearly not independent polls either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If anything, their purpose is probably to sow mischief in GOP primaries, with the hope that it will help Democrats in the general election. For instance, back in October, the DGA released a <a href="https://democraticgovernors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DGA-Polling-Memo-Status-of-the-MA-GOP-Primary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of the Republican primary for governor of Massachusetts showing that conservative former state Rep. Geoff Diehl led moderate Gov. Charlie Baker, 50 percent to 29 percent. That poll may have contributed to doubt that Baker could win the primary, which in turn may have contributed to Baker’s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/01/metro/baker-telling-allies-he-isnt-running-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December decision to retire</a>. (Though to be clear, Baker almost certainly conducted his own polling and analysis to inform that decision.) Regardless, though, that decision rocketed Massachusetts to the top of the list of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governorships most likely to flip in 2022</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in November, the DGA also sponsored a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvrzSIZ8TJrIoGanRopkOzBbjR-mFv4v/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> of the GOP gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania — the results of which promoted a narrative that there is <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-republican-party-senate-governor-endorsement-20220205.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no clear front-runner</a> and that that could lead to the nomination of far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who <a href="https://www.witf.org/2021/05/28/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-unlikely-to-face-consequences-over-newly-released-jan-6-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection</a> at the U.S. Capitol. Mastriano took 18 percent in the survey, more than any other candidate. And in the absence of more recent polling of the race, we have no independent confirmation of how close that result is to reality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of internal polls — and even some non-internal polls. But unfortunately, they’re most of the data that we currently have for 2022 primaries, so sometimes using them is unavoidable. That’s OK as long as you do so with your eyes open to the fact that they are trying to sell you an agenda. And once you factor in that agenda, sometimes internal polls can tell you something interesting after all — if not about the actual state of the race, then about what one of the actors in that race wants you to think.</p>



<h2 id="other-polling-bites"><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A majority of Americans (62 percent) <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/welcoming-immigration-policies-remain-popular-but-immigration-is-not-a-critical-issue-for-most-americans/">backed a pathway to citizenship</a> for undocumented immigrants and believed more broadly that immigrants strengthen American society (56 percent), according to a recently published survey from the Public Religion Research Institute, conducted last September. But even though a majority of Americans from most religious backgrounds that PRRI surveyed supported creating a pathway to citizenship — with Black Protestants most in favor, at 75 percent — there was one notable exception: White evangelical Protestants were the least likely (47 percent) to support a pathway to citizenship. </li><li>The share of Americans extremely satisfied with their romantic relationship <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_020722/">dropped by 10 percentage points</a> since a year ago, according to a Jan. 20-24 poll from Monmouth University. But divorce lawyers shouldn’t get too excited: Majorities were still extremely satisfied with their relationship (60 percent) and felt that their partner is extremely important to their happiness (54 percent). In fact, the decline in relationship satisfaction puts the current number within the range of pre-pandemic figures, after an 11-point rise in Monmouth’s May 2020 survey.</li><li>On that romantic note, Americans aren’t enthused by Valentine’s Day. Fifty-eight percent of adults said that Valentine’s Day is not a “<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2022/02/08/valentines-day-ranks-behind-major-holidays">real special occasion</a>,” according to a Jan. 27-31 poll from YouGov. Of the nine other holidays YouGov asked about, Americans preferred every one of them more than Valentine’s Day. Christmas was the most popular, leading Valentine’s Day by 69 points, and Americans even preferred the second-least-popular holiday, Labor Day, over Valentine’s Day by 8 points.</li><li>Twelve percent of registered voters ranked “division in the country” as <a href="https://politics.georgetown.edu/2022/02/03/battleground-civility-poll-voters-agree-politics-has-grown-less-civil-since-covid-19-and-beginning-of-biden-presidency/">the most important issue facing America</a>, just narrowly behind the rising cost of living (13 percent), according to a Jan. 22-27 poll conducted by Lake Research Partners and The Tarrance Group for Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service. Two-thirds of voters said that the pandemic had led to politics getting worse, while 58 percent felt that the Jan. 6 Capitol attack had made violent political protests more likely to happen in the future. In total, 43 percent said that politics had become less civil during Biden’s presidency.</li><li>Fewer Americans believe that Trump <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/">bears “some” or “a lot” of responsibility</a> for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, according to a Jan. 10-17 poll from the Pew Research Center. The share of Americans assigning blame to Trump declined from 75 percent in January 2021 to 67 percent in January 2022. This change resulted from a smaller share of Americans (43 percent this January, compared with 52 percent last January) saying Trump bore “a lot” of responsibility, while the share assigning him “some” responsibility was nearly identical.</li></ul><h2 id="biden-approval"><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p data-paragraph="main">Americans <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are pessimistic</a> about one of the weirdest economies in recent memory, and their negativity is largely due to inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced today that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices increased 7.5 percent year-over-year in January 2022</a>, the highest figure since 1982, and as such, more expensive milk, furniture and cars — and the fear that their prices <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will continue to skyrocket</a> — are likely to remain top of mind for Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, of course, has led to a lot of finger-pointing as to who — or what — is to blame for the price increases we’re seeing. Democrats have <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-democrats-supply-chain-prices-midterms-f6de1ceb-21a1-469c-a83f-88f48fc07a4b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed supply chain deficiencies</a> due to COVID-19, as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/10/white-house-inflation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large corporations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/business/biden-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monopolies</a>. Republicans, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/10/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-whats-their-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked</a> President Biden’s legislative agenda, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-are-they-right-2021-11-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming that his signature pieces of legislation</a> — most notably the American Rescue Plan featuring $1,400 stimulus checks paid directly to many Americans — are to blame. And to be sure, whether fair or not, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans</a> do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/business/economy/biden-economy-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame Biden</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what <em>is </em>responsible for inflation in the U.S.? Is it all about the pandemic supply chain, as many Democrats claim, or corporate greed? Or does it have more to do with Biden’s policies, as Republicans have posited?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="inflation-isn-t-just-a-supply-chain-issue-and-the-stimulus-likely-made-it-worse"><strong>Inflation isn’t just a supply-chain issue, and the stimulus likely made it worse</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the Democrats’ most consistent talking points has been that the COVID-19-afflicted supply chain is to blame for our current levels of inflation. Biden has even gone as far as to say that supply chain issues have “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAqwiD_CH-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything to do</a>” with it, while House Democrats work to craft legislation <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/house-democrats-pivot-economy-legislative-win-00003385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted at ameliorating supply chain issues</a>. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/inflation-economy-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many economists</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/11/22829221/inflation-rate-cpi-supply-chain-biden-transitory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> say that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/15/omicron-supply-chain-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the foundering supply chain</a> has played a heavy hand in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/10/24/22743104/supply-chain-inflation-shortages-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving up prices</a>, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The thinking goes as follows: Americans stopped using their gym, nail salons and other services as their spending patterns rapidly changed in 2020, and the global supply chain — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/business/shortages-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already had issues</a> —&nbsp; was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/business/inflation-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not equipped to deal with the surge</a> in demand for consumer durables (e.g., home workout equipment, office furniture) after the initial global economic shutdown. Combine that rapid demand increase with a shortage in supply, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inflation-definition.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-supply-chain&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_top_links_recirc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you get higher prices</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the same time, this Democratic talking point has its limits, as it’s become clear to many economists that American inflation isn’t <em>just</em> a supply chain issue: Our economic response — namely, the trillions of dollars of COVID-19 stimulus paid out over the last 24 months — appears to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-13/u-s-inflation-is-starting-to-look-like-a-stimulus-led-outlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meaningful differentiator</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A good way to tease this out is to look at Europe, which has faced similar supply chain issues and an even worse oil shock, as it is more dependent on foreign oil <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&amp;t=6#:~:text=How%20much%20oil%20consumed%20by,day%20(b%2Fd)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the U.S.</a> And yet, European countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/business/ecb-europe-interest-rates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have experienced lower inflation</a>, perhaps due in part to <a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2021/number/4/article/fiscal-stimulus-lessons-from-the-us-to-the-eu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their smaller government response</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Global supply chain problems affect every country in the world, but the United States has had more inflation than other countries,” said <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/people/jason-furman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Furman</a>, a professor of economics at Harvard University and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama. “If you look compared to Europe, in the United States goods consumption is higher, and services consumption is higher than what it is [in Europe].”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason for that higher consumption is government spending. In 2020, a divided Congress under former President Donald Trump passed two separate pieces of legislation — first the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion CARES Act</a> in March, which <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/28/how-many-people-will-get-1200-in-every-state/111604090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doled out</a> $1,200 checks to most single adults and even more to families, then a $900 billion package <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/21/948862052/house-passes-900-billion-coronavirus-relief-bill-ending-months-long-stalemate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in December</a> that, among other aid, issued $600 targeted checks. But then in March 2021, Democrats passed another round of government stimulus in a $1.9 trillion relief package — including $1,400 direct payments to individual Americans — which some experts warned at the time <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/summers-warns-u-s-risks-rising-inflation-amid-massive-stimulus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might cause inflation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it does appear that this most recent round of government spending is at least partially responsible for our current levels of inflation. An October 2021 paper found, for example, that the American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2021/october/is-american-rescue-plan-taking-us-back-to-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely made inflation slightly worse</a>, causing significant (but small and fleeting) upward pressure on prices, and many experts have stood by their 2021 assertions that the extra stimulus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/business/economy/inflation-biden-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would lead to inflation</a>. Of course, Biden’s additional stimulus was arguably <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/2021-was-a-year-of-bold-economic-policy-that-must-be-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary for Americans to participate in the economy</a> at the time, and polling <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/19/most-americans-say-another-round-of-covid-19-economic-relief-will-be-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found widespread support</a> among Americans for more relief. But it has also led <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-target-biden-democrats-over-inflation-what-would-they-do-n1284839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans to claim</a> that Biden’s policies are responsible for the historic price increases we’re seeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furman stressed to me that inflation likely would have been high even without a COVID-19 relief bill, however, because of a reopening economy and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/what-are-base-effects-and-how-do-they-distort-inflation-yahoo-u-113754047.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base effect distortions</a>. Moreover, rising gas prices — one of the most tangible ways in which Americans process inflation — likely have nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan and much more to do with the dynamics of global oil. There is at least some evidence, though, that government spending has caused inflation, beyond the explanation that it’s merely been a supply chain issue.</p>



<h2 id="but-not-all-government-spending-leads-to-inflation"><strong>But not all government spending leads to inflation</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Critically, however, despite what many Republicans claim, not all government spending has the same effect on inflation. In fact, historically government spending hasn’t usually led to inflation. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014292114001494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 paper</a> in the European Economic Review found, for example, that the effect of government spending on inflation post-World War II was “<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/may/how-does-government-spending-affect-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not statistically different from zero</a>.” But <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/dupor/sel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Dupor</a>, a co-author of that study and vice president of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told me that the size of the intervention matters — and that could help explain why government spending today has spurred inflation but hadn’t in recent memory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The big difference, I think, from now relative to that is just the enormity of the government spending,” Dupor said. “That could explain why it wasn&#8217;t finding big effects, while there could be big effects now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, not all government spending the Biden administration has greenlit has likely contributed to inflation. For example, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law in November is unlikely to have contributed to inflation for a number of reasons. First of all, very <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/biden-infrastructure-bill-spending-economy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little of it has been paid for</a> at this point. Second, it’s targeted at ramping up the productive capacity of the economy — i.e., investing in new technologies and creating jobs — which means it might <a href="https://www.epi.org/open-letter-from-nobel-laureates-in-support-of-economic-recovery-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even tamp down inflation</a>. That’s different from the American Rescue Plan, whose $1,400 stimulus checks don’t build up the economy in the same way, according to the economists I spoke with.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans, however, aren’t necessarily making this kind of distinction when it comes to government spending. According to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/26/biden-poll-social-spending-inflation-00001785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January Politico-Harvard survey</a>, 43 percent of Americans think that the bipartisan infrastructure bill will increase inflation, while just 10 percent think it will decrease inflation (although 35 percent did say they think inflation will remain unchanged).&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/thomas-philippon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Philippon</a>, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said that his biggest concern with the recent inflation brought about by the stimulus is that it muddies the waters of government spending in the eyes of voters. That, in turn, Philippon said, expends political capital that can’t be used to tackle other key issues, like infrastructure spending or child poverty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People then lump together all kinds of government spending, the good and the bad,” Philippon said.</p>



<h2 id="big-corporations-aren-t-the-biggest-cause-but">Big corporations aren&#8217;t the biggest cause, but …</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, some Democrats have singled out big companies and monopolies for their perceived role in driving up prices. Figures across the party’s ideological gamut -— from Sens. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/25/inflation-cause-democrats-amplify-nonsense-corporate-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/12/1072295047/inflation-is-still-surging-and-some-democrats-see-one-culprit-greedy-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a> to Biden — have posited that big businesses, by jacking up their prices in the middle of a pandemic, are to blame for inflation, and that a lack of competition has allowed corporate behemoths to raise their prices unabated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, this explanation appears less plausible than other messaging on inflation. Profit-seeking companies didn’t suddenly become more profit-seeking during the pandemic, nor were they more generous before it. Additionally, corporate concentration has <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164974/corporate-concentration-inflation-price-gouging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown steadily since the 1990s</a> — an era of historically low inflation. <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/inflation-market-power-and-price-controls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A January survey of economists</a> at the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found most experts in agreement on both questions: Inflation wasn’t explained by big firms deciding to get richer, and antitrust interventions — such as those tossed about by the Biden administration — weren’t likely to curb inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is an element of the prices we’re seeing today — and how Americans are responding to them — that could be explained by big business run amok. Philippon, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose book</a> “The Great Reversal” focuses on how a lack of competition and corporate concentration have defined the modern American economy, told me that one reason why inflation is such a big deal in the U.S. is that prices were already so high to begin with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That&#8217;s not a statement about rapid inflation, it&#8217;s a statement about slowly rising profit margins that slowly choke off the middle class,” Philippon said. “One reason it&#8217;s particularly painful in the U.S. is that prices were already high, people&#8217;s purchasing power, the real value of their wages was already being eroded by market power before. Then when you add to that a burst of inflation, it&#8217;s even more painful.”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That may explain why recent polling has found that Americans <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-find-link-between-inflation-and-corporate-greed-convincing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sympathetic</a> to arguments that attribute inflation to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/19/inflation-companies-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate greed</a>, and why Biden is singing a fairly populist tune on inflation. But as with all aspects of messaging on the issue, whether Democrats or Republicans are more right on the facts of inflation has very little to do with its potential electoral impact. Prices have to stabilize for Americans to feel good about the economy — and for Democrats to feel good about their chances in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t think there’s any message that would make people feel good about 7 percent inflation,” Furman said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p data-paragraph="main">Dinesh D’Souza can always be counted on to have a bespoke conspiracy theory. In the trailer for his “2,000 Mules” “documentary,” faux static flickers across the screen over footage of what appears to be people voting at ballot drop boxes. A slow, mournful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” plays in the background. And that’s when D’Souza, a pro-Trump conservative personality who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/dinesh-dsouza-facts-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pardoned by the former president</a> after being convicted of making illegal campaign contributions, drops the (totally unproven and false) bombshell: Thousands of “mules” stuffed ballot boxes to steal the election for President Biden.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is D’Souza’s version of the Big Lie, the unfounded claim that widespread voter fraud plagued the 2020 presidential election and that President Joe Biden’s win was illegitimate. But it is not the only version — the Big Lie means different things to different people.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third of Americans — and a majority of Republicans — <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_012722/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe the Big Lie</a>, but the disparate theories include the <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/oct/15/steve-scalises-flawed-argument-states-didnt-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flawed-but-plausible</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/donald-trump-georgia-2020-election-dead-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely</a> and the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-hugo-chavez-dead-since-2013-became-responsible-for-trumps-election-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illogical</a>. While no two Big Lie theories are identical in composition, they do share commonality in function. In-depth polling and academic research reveal belief in the Big Lie is incredibly resilient and incredibly influential, swaying <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the creation of new voting laws</a> and shaping <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/02/07/more-than-80-pro-deniers-are-running-for-key-state-offices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election campaigns</a> for 2022 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a mountain of baseless overlapping claims piled up inside the stultifying biodome of the Big Lie: voters casting multiple ballots, dead people voting, ballot-counting machines flipping votes, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-fact-check-debunking-italy-gate/fact-check-evidence-disproves-claims-of-italian-conspiracy-to-meddle-in-u-s-election-idUSKBN29K2N8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign</a> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dominion-servers-germany-seized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nations</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9900544617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacking</a> systems to swap totals. The Big Lie is an à la carte conspiracy theory — a bit like QAnon in that respect — where adherents pick and choose what sounds right to them and disregard what doesn’t. Each individual who believes the Big Lie has their own suspicions about what took place, a personal recipe of different conspiracies to nourish their belief that the election was illegitimate. In right-wing chat groups on the messaging app Telegram, these theories are traded as casually as chats about the weather.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What’s going to be any different this time?!” a user in a QAnon Telegram chat wrote about the midterm elections this past Tuesday evening. “Wait till 3am on election night and lots of mail in ballots and dead people voting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brian Cates, a writer for the far-right publication The Epoch Times, was less morbid and more focused on the levers of power when he posted to his nearly 80,000 followers on Telegram earlier this week. “[W]hat happened on election night? Trump was surging to victory. They had to shut everything down and then spent THREE DAYS furiously ginning up enough fake votes to hand Biden the &#8216;win&#8217; on Friday night.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Every iteration of the Big Lie, though, is wrong. The ones in the darkest corner of the Internet? Wrong. The ones brought forward in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits by the Trump campaign</a>? Wrong. The ones already debunked by news sources? Still wrong. There is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of widespread fraud</a> in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, polling gives us a glimpse of the most popular theories on the Big Lie menu. Last summer, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-belief-voter-fraud-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov/CBS News poll</a> asked voters who thought there had been widespread voter fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exactly what they thought had happened. They were asked about various sources of voting and how much of the voter fraud came from those sources, either “a lot of it,” “some of it” or “hardly any or none.”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Seventy-seven percent said “a lot” of voter fraud and irregularities had come from ballots cast by mail, and 70 percent said a lot of it had come from voting machines or equipment that were manipulated, but just 22 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in person. Racism also appeared to inform a lot of thinking around the Big Lie: 72 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in major cities and urban areas, compared with 22 percent and 14 percent who said a lot of it had come from suburbs and rural areas, respectively. And 39 percent of those who believed voter fraud was widespread said “a lot” of fraud had come from ballots cast in Black communities, while 25 percent said so for white communities and 27 percent said so for voters in Hispanic communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/toplines-and-crosstabs-december-2021-national-poll-presidential-election-jan-6th-insurrection-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fielded a similar poll</a> in December, asking those who said Biden’s victory was probably or definitely illegitimate to choose from a list of options all the reasons they believed that to be true. In that group, 83 percent said they believed fraudulent ballots had been counted, 81 percent said they believed absentee ballots had been cast using dead people’s identities and 76 percent endorsed the theory that ineligible voters had cast ballots. Just 39 percent said they believed voting machines had been reprogrammed by foreign governments to change ballots from Trump to Biden.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s important to note that people are not just picking everything,” said Alexander Theodoridis, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who fielded the survey. “Pure expressive responding would be like, ‘Yeah, everything was wrong with this election. It’s all this stuff.’ Whereas the way they did it suggests they do have at least some critical view of some of these [theories].”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea of expressive responding — the tendency for people to give answers to pollsters that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-meteor/trump-clinton-many-young-americans-prefer-giant-meteor-poll-finds-idUSKCN12I20S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflect their feelings</a> or values, but not necessarily their true beliefs — has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/no-america-is-not-on-the-cusp-of-a-civil-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been cited</a> as a possible explanation for the high percentage of Republicans in polls who say they believe the election was stolen. Some Republicans, in other words, might <em>say</em> they think the election was stolen when what they really mean is they think the results of the election stink.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Theodoridis has used some polling tools to test how genuine belief in the Big Lie is. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/07/republicans-big-lie-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He and his colleague Lane Cuthbert</a> used <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a research technique</a> meant to reduce expressive responding that went something like this: Survey respondents were divided into two groups, given a list of statements and asked <em>how many</em> of the statements they agreed with, but not which ones. The list of statements were identical, except one group was given an extra statement that the researchers wanted to test on: “Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election was legitimate.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Basically, if the average person in the control group chooses two out of four items and the average person in the treatment group chooses three out of the five items, you know that the only difference between those averages is the additional fifth item,” Theodoridis said.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using this method, Theodoridis and Cuthbert found that only 28 percent of Republicans thought that Biden was legitimately elected. In their survey, <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Jan6thAnniversaryCrosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 percent of Republicans</a> said Biden’s victory was legitimate, and 8 percent said they weren’t sure. Theodoridis said this suggests that the Republicans in the survey were expressing a genuine belief.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if some or all of the Americans who say they believe the Big Lie don’t really mean it, the consequences of that expressed belief are very real. A forthcoming study based on a series of daily tracking surveys shows that even when those who believe in the Big Lie are confronted with evidence that counters it, their beliefs don’t waver. Kevin Arceneaux, a political science professor at Sciences Po, and Rory Truex, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, teamed up to run tracking surveys of U.S. registered voters from October 2020 through January 2021. As part of the surveys, the pair asked respondents who had identified Trump as the winner of the 2020 election about whether certain scenarios (such as Trump conceding, the Electoral College awarding more votes to Biden or Biden being sworn in) would change their minds. Of those registered voters, 45 percent said they would change their mind if Trump conceded, 31 percent said they would if Biden won the Electoral College, and 38 percent said they would accept the results if Biden was sworn in. But as those events occurred and Arceneaux and Truex continued their survey, belief in the Big Lie remained relatively unchanged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not totally surprising — if you ask a hypothetical question, you get a hypothetical answer,” Arceneaux said. “I was surprised how much the aggregate results did not really move in response to actual events that happened.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Arceneaux and Truex’s work revealed that not only is belief in the Big Lie tenacious, it also impacts voters’ views of politicians. When they asked Americans to compare hypothetical political candidates, Republican voters favored candidates who embraced the Big Lie by an average of 5.7 percentage points to candidates who accurately said Trump lost the election. This suggests that the Big Lie is not going anywhere soon and that it will have a meaningful sway on elections. Already we’ve witnessed the Big Lie being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-jan-6-election-lie/2022/01/05/82f4cad4-6cb6-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wielded as a campaign tool</a> by Republican candidates across the country, demonstrating the power of this belief among the party’s voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as polls continue to capture the millions of Americans who endorse the Big Lie, precisely what they believe matters less than how that belief influences their actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Lasting Legacy Of RedliningWe looked at 138 formerly redlined cities and found most were still segregated — just like they were designed to be.</p>
<p>By <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/ryan-best/">Ryan Best</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/contributors/elena-mejia-lutz/">Elena Mejía</a></p>

<p><em>HOUSING DIVIDE</em> is a partnership between ABC News and FiveThirtyEight examining racial inequities in housing, access to housing and the historical and present-day causes of those inequities. See more of our coverage on <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/nightline">Nightline</a> and <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/half-century-federal-oversight-segregated-neighborhoods-pervasive-abc/story?id=82678035">ABC News</a>.</p>
<p>In 1939, officials working with the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) went to Cleveland, Ohio, as part of the agency’s national effort to grade neighborhoods based on their perceived mortgage-lending risk.</p>
<p>One of the neighborhoods that officials visited — now known mostly as Fairfax — was 55 percent Black, and as such, they gave this area a “D” grade, meaning they thought Fairfax was “hazardous,” or at high risk for defaulting on mortgage loans. <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=12/41.498/-81.769&amp;maps=0&amp;city=cleveland-oh&amp;area=D21">In their report</a>, HOLC officials concluded that property prices were trending down due to a “strong colored infiltration” and that there was a “detrimental change of ownership occupancy from white to colored.” Fairfax, like <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/17/realestate/what-is-redlining.html">most metropolitan neighborhoods</a> where Black people lived in the early 1900s, was then marked with red ink in the HOLC’s maps — a practice referred to as redlining.</p>
<p>It’s been over 80 years since the lines were drawn in Fairfax and over 50 years since <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-11/50-years-after-the-fair-housing-act-redlining-persists">the use of redlining was legally banned</a>, but the impact of redlining is still felt in cities like Cleveland, where redlined neighborhoods are some of the most starkly segregated in the country.</p>
<p>“BEST”“DESIRABLE”“DECLINING”“HAZARDOUS”<a href="https://s.538.io/redlining/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8Bhttps://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/41.49/-81.874&amp;maps=0&amp;city=cleveland-oh">THE HOME OWNERS’ LOAN CORPORATION’S MAP OF THE CLEVELAND METROPOLITAN DISTRICT AND CUYAHOGA COUNTY, COPYRIGHTED BY COMMERCIAL SURVEY COMPANY, 1937</a></p>

<p>WHITEBLACKLATINOASIANOTHER“BEST”“DESIRABLE”“DECLINING”“HAZARDOUS”</p>
<p>But it’s not just Cleveland. In its 20 years of existence, the now-defunct HOLC drew hundreds of these maps across the country. In total, we analyzed the demographics of 138 metropolitan areas where HOLC drew maps, using data provided by the University of Richmond’s <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/">Mapping Inequality</a> project and by the 2020 census. And we found that nearly all formerly redlined zones in the country are still disproportionately Black, Latino or Asian compared with their surrounding metropolitan area, while two-thirds of greenlined zones — neighborhoods that HOLC deemed “best” for mortgage lending — are still overwhelmingly white.</p>
<p>“The redlining maps are like the Rosetta stone of American cities,” said LaDale Winling, a professor of history at Virginia Tech and one of the researchers behind the Mapping Inequality project. Winling told us that these maps were used to codify and institutionalize practices that had already been ongoing at a more scattershot level within the real estate industry.</p>
<p>You can see the effects of that institutionalized segregation clearly in this national map of formerly greenlined and redlined zones:</p>
<p>Most formerly redlined zones are people of color; most greenlined zones are white</p>

<p>Includes only micro- and metropolitan areas with both A- (“best”) and D-rated (“hazardous”) zones in their redlining map — 138 of a total 143 metropolitan areas in the University of Richmond’s Mapping Inequality project. Circle sizes are based on total population in the surrounding area of that metro’s redlining map and positions are approximate, meaning they do not represent exact locations.</p>
<p>But despite formerly redlined zones sharing a purpose — to disproportionately deny loans to low-income Americans and, in particular, Black and minority Americans — the legacy of redlining differs from city to city and region to region.</p>
<p>Formerly redlined zones in the Northeast and Midwest are among the most segregated areas in the country. In those regions, a higher proportion of Black Americans live in redlined zones compared with those zones’ surrounding areas — and a higher proportion than can be found in other regions of the country. Meanwhile, in the South, formerly redlined zones aren’t as segregated. But less residential segregation doesn’t mean that the South is a more equitable region for Black and minority Americans, especially given its history of slavery and the Jim Crow era. Additionally, even though redlining was a housing policy that heavily targeted Black Americans, redlining has also affected immigrants and other minorities, in particular Latino Americans — something visible today in places like California. But at the same time, huge demographic shifts, suburbanization, urban renewal and gentrification have also changed the landscape of many of these cities. In some cities, formerly redlined zones are now whiter and more developed than they were in the 1940s. In other cities, there are more Black people than white people living in formerly greenlined areas, or areas that government officials once rated as “best.”</p>
<p>There is no one legacy when it comes to redlining. And its legacy is particularly devastating because, as we were told by Stephen Menendian, assistant director of the Othering &amp; Belonging Institute at the University of California, Berkeley, &#8220;Housing really is at the core of every expression of racial inequality in America.&#8221;</p>
<p><a href="https://s.538.io/redlining/#explore-top">Jump to explore your city</a>The myth of the northern “Promised Land”</p>
<p>The legacy of redlining is particularly pronounced in the Northeast and Midwest,1 where cities like Cleveland, Pittsburgh and Chicago are home to some of the most segregated formerly redlined zones in the country. This segregation is especially entrenched in redlined cities with large Black populations. Of the 19 such cities in these regions, 16 were still segregated, with over two-thirds as many Black people living in formerly redlined areas as in the surrounding area. White people, meanwhile, made up less than a third of the population of formerly redlined areas and were vastly overrepresented in formerly greenlined areas.2</p>
<p>One reason northern cities remain so segregated is because of what historians call the Great Migration and Second Great Migration. From the 1910s through the 1970s, millions of Black Americans fled the oppressive Jim Crow South in <a href="https://rosaparksbiography.org/bio/the-northern-promised-land-that-wasnt/">search of jobs in industrialized cities and a better life in the Northeast and Midwest</a>. But Black Americans didn’t find <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7297198/">refuge from systemic racism</a> in these regions, especially when it came to housing policy.</p>
<p>In fact, scholars have found that the increase in Black Americans in these regions led to growing efforts like redlining in northern metro areas to keep Black Americans and other immigrants in specific areas and prevent them from moving into predominantly white neighborhoods. Consequently, Black families had little opportunity to build generational wealth.</p>
<p>Take Pittsburgh. It saw a massive uptick in its population in the early 1900s, but Black Americans moving in were limited to <a href="https://aaregistry.org/story/the-hill-district-pittsburgh/">pre-war segregated areas</a> like the Hill District, which in 1937 was officially <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=12/40.442/-80.087&amp;maps=0&amp;city=pittsburgh-pa&amp;area=D10&amp;adimage=4/49.668/-138.955">redlined</a> by HOLC officials because of what they described as an “infiltration” and “concentration of negro and undesirables.”</p>
<p>Today, the Hill District, like all neighborhoods encompassing formerly redlined zones in the Steel City, is still overwhelmingly segregated. Pittsburgh’s formerly redlined zones have, on average, close to three times as many Black people living in them as compared to their surrounding areas — making Pittsburgh the second most segregated redlined city in the country,3 just behind Cleveland.</p>

<p>WHITE74.9%BLACK12.9%</p>
<p>One reason why an area like the Hill District is still so segregated is that redlining created a lack of investment in parts of Pittsburgh that persists today. Last year, a team of researchers <a href="https://newpittsburghcourier.com/2021/09/11/report-most-banks-give-citys-black-neighborhoods-few-loans/">released a report</a> that looked at bank lending data and public investment documents in Pittsburgh from 2007 to 2019, finding that just 7 percent of home mortgage loans went to predominantly minority neighborhoods in that time period, despite the residents of these neighborhoods comprising <a href="https://www.pghlending.com/_files/ugd/dcc000_182adaaa28e94fc9ac70a51578b56c70.pdf#page=23">almost 21 percent</a> of the city’s population. And out of $11.8 billion in loans to borrowers, less than 4 percent went to Black people.</p>
<p>“[Redlining] biased where investment was made,” Bruce Mitchell, a senior analyst at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition told us, with “hazardous” areas like Hill District suffering from years of neglect. Mitchell said it&#8217;s this lack of investment in formerly redlined areas that is one of redlining’s most devastating consequences.</p>
<p>Like Pittsburgh, Chicago saw a huge surge in its Black population as part of the Great Migration. Many Black people moved to Chicago’s South Side, north of Washington Park — the area where many of Chicago’s redlines were ultimately drawn.</p>
<p>At the time government appraisers drew those lines, housing near parks, lakes and swimming pools was typically inhabited by white people, but in one zone surrounding Washington Park appraisers noted that it had been “almost completely monopolized by the colored race.” <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=11/41.839/-87.885&amp;maps=0&amp;city=chicago-il&amp;area=D74&amp;adview=full&amp;adimage=3/41.574/-141.328">Appraisers concluded</a> that Black Americans couldn’t be “closed in” and Washington Park was already “doomed,” so they drew a redline around the area in their map.</p>
<p>Today, there are over 90 percent more Black Chicagoans in redlined zones than in the surrounding area.</p>

<p>In the South, most formerly redlined areas are also still starkly segregated — 28 of the 31 cities we analyzed.4 And while they aren’t as segregated as formerly redlined zones in the North, the formerly <i>greenlined</i> zones in the South are more segregated than in the North. On average, the South has almost twice as many white people living in greenlined zones compared with those zones’ surrounding areas — a much higher share than is seen in the North.</p>
<p>That’s important for understanding the legacy of redlining in the South because slavery and Jim Crow laws have played a much bigger role in the South’s unique form of segregation. Winling, who was one of the researchers behind the Mapping Inequality project, told us that Black Americans in the North began to move into greenlined areas after white populations started to flee because city neighborhoods were rapidly diversifying. But in some southern cities, he said, this didn’t happen to the same extent.</p>
<p>Take a city like Atlanta. Its neighborhood of Buckhead held <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-22/buckhead-fights-atlanta-s-multifamily-housing-push">the headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan</a> from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s. Currently, Buckhead is the city’s <a href="https://www.axios.com/local/atlanta/2021/11/05/buckhead-atlanta-secession-buckxit-impact">whitest and wealthiest</a> neighborhood, and it’s also where most of the “best” areas were drawn during in the late 1930s. And as can be seen on the map below, those “best” areas are 80 percent white.</p>

<p>ATLANTA&#8217;S SURROUNDING AREA:</p>
<p>WHITE36.9%BLACK45.7%</p>
<p>Buckhead also remains very segregated from the rest of Atlanta. In fact, neighborhood residents are now <a href="https://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2021/09/01/buckhead-inches-closer-to-seceding-from-the-city-of-atlanta/">backing an effort</a> in the city’s legislature to create their own city and secede from Atlanta, a <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/atlantacitygeorgia">majority Black city</a>. If this were to happen, it would be financially devastating for Atlanta since the city would lose <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-01/buckhead-cityhood-vote-district-wants-to-secede-from-atlanta">an estimated 38 percent of its tax revenue</a>.</p>
<p>According to Andre Perry, a senior fellow at Brookings Metro and author of “Know Your Price: Valuing Black Lives and Property in America’s Black Cities,” it is these white enclaves in the South “where power is often exercised the most.”</p>
<p>Part of the way these areas amassed power was through the South’s long history of violent racism toward Black Americans, especially those moving to predominantly white neighborhoods. Consider Birmingham, Alabama, a city where <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/40193532?read-now=1&amp;refreqid=excelsior%3A7db422490180d69e9d7d29353ee7c36c&amp;seq=14#page_scan_tab_contents">bombings against Black residents were so rampant</a> in the mid-1900s — there were more than 50 house bombings and burnings from the late 1940s until the mid-1960s — that Birmingham became known as “Bombingham.”</p>
<p>This ongoing violence, in addition to redlining, meant that much of Birmingham’s white population was confined to its greenlined zones. This pattern is still visible today, with the share of white people living in the city’s formerly greenlined zones being over twice as high as the share living in the surrounding area. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/half-century-federal-oversight-segregated-neighborhoods-pervasive-abc/story?id=82678035">per an ABC News analysis of mortgage-lending data</a>, people of color are still less likely to have their loans approved in majority-white neighborhoods.</p>

<p>BIRMINGHAM&#8217;S SURROUNDING AREA:</p>

<p>But parts of the South’s racial makeup are changing, albeit slowly. Since the 1990s, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2022/01/14/black-migration-south/">more and more Black Americans have moved to the South</a> — a movement demographers are terming “The New Great Migration.” This has changed cities like Atlanta and Birmingham, which have also seen an influx of Asian Americans and other minorities, but according to Taylor, the Princeton professor, the South’s fixation on white exclusivity in places like Buckhead is still a big problem.</p>
<p>“People are returning to places that are just as segregated, just as excluded,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>“Anti-Black racism hurt everyone”</p>
<p>The harm redlining has caused Black Americans is extensive, but redlining has also affected other minorities in the U.S. — particularly the country’s growing Latino population. In some cities, government officials directly targeted Latinos with their redlining maps while in others, the continued lack of investment in formerly redlined areas has caused disproportionate harm to Latino communities.</p>
<p>Of 50 cities across the country with large Latino populations,5 we found that 72 percent have segregated Latino communities living in formerly redlined areas.</p>
<p>“That’s why I always say, anti-Black racism hurt everyone,” Perry said. “There&#8217;s lots of places where … anti-Black racism and hate against brown people and other groups really limited the amount of housing options for people of color, and the only places that they can generally go are formerly redlined or Black neighborhoods.”</p>
<p>Take San Diego. Its formerly redlined zones are the most segregated in the West, with 76 percent more Latinos living in these neighborhoods compared to the surrounding areas. Latinos were targeted <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=15/32.719/-117.131&amp;maps=0&amp;city=san-diego-ca&amp;area=D5">by HOLC appraisers</a>, too, as they wrote in their 1935 report that the area southeast of Fairmont Park had “many Mexicans with a definite trend of infiltration.”</p>

<p>WHITE40.9%LATINO33.1%</p>
<p>In other parts of California, appraisers used even harsher, more racist language. In 1939, San Gabriel, a city in Los Angeles County, was <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining/#loc=13/34.101/-118.173&amp;maps=0&amp;city=los-angeles-ca&amp;area=D13">90 percent Mexican American</a>, and appraisers described them as “peon Mexicans” and as a “distinctly subversive racial influence.”</p>
<p>Up until 1930, the U.S. census <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-the-census-misses/">classified</a> Mexicans as white, but in the 1930 census, the government classified them as their own race. According to Jerry González, a historian at the University of Texas at San Antonio, this allowed the U.S. government to more easily target Mexican Americans as a racial threat.</p>
<p>This targeting was especially clear in redlining practices of the time. González told us that officials would specifically identify Mexicans living in places like Los Angeles, and then include language in their reports like, “do not sell this home to persons not fully of the Caucasian race.” González said that language gave housing officials the flexibility to more easily discriminate.</p>

<p>WHITE25.2%LATINO47.6%</p>
<p>It’s not just Latinos that HOLC officials targeted either. Appraisers described other areas derisively as a “melting pot … long been thoroughly blighted,” also classifying Asian Americans as “subversive racial elements” in California. Today, San Gabriel’s Asian and Latino communities are still segregated from the city’s white population.</p>
<p>Beyond the red lines</p>
<p>Of course, segregation in many cities doesn’t fit neatly inside formerly redlined zones. This doesn’t mean, however, that these cities avoided or overcame a racist housing system. On the contrary, housing segregation manifests in ways that go far beyond HOLC’s color lines on these maps.</p>
<p>&#8220;The refusal of federal agencies to issue mortgages to those neighborhoods in the 1930s and 40s — that&#8217;s one of many policies that were followed,&#8221; Richard Rothstein, author of “The Color of Law,” said. &#8220;But it doesn&#8217;t entirely determine today&#8217;s landscape, and there are many, many other policies that get ignored that are equally important.&#8221;</p>
<p>For instance, even though it is <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/city-snapshot-detroit">one of the most segregated cities</a> in the country, Detroit’s segregation doesn’t match up with its formerly redlined zones. This is in large part because as Black southerners moved into Detroit during the Great Migration, white Detroiters responded by <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w22077/w22077.pdf">leaving the city in droves</a>, mostly moving out to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america">federally subsidized and racially homogenous suburbs</a> — a migration that historians call “white flight.” White Detroiters went through great lengths to keep their wealthy suburbs exclusively white, too, with measures as extreme as building <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/detroit-segregation-wall/">a half-mile-long concrete wall</a> to physically separate themselves from Black families.</p>

<p>WHITE33.1%BLACK43.4%</p>
<p>DETROIT&#8217;S SURROUNDING AREA:</p>
<p>WHITE57.0%BLACK27.1%</p>
<p>According to Joe Darden, a professor of geography, environment and spatial sciences at Michigan State University, the Detroit metro area continues to experience white flight, too. As Black Detroiters move into predominantly white suburbs, many white Detroiters move away — further perpetuating residential segregation.</p>
<p>“The future of Black suburbanization is going to be looking at those places that used to be predominantly white, and turning them more and more to be predominantly Black,” Darden said. “As Blacks move in, whites, even to this day, still have a tendency to move further and further out.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Philadelphia is seeing the opposite happen: More white people are moving into its formerly redlined zones. And as this occurs, property values increase and lower-income people, many of whom are Black, can no longer afford to stay.</p>
<p>This gentrification has fundamentally shifted where Philadelphia’s varying demographics reside so that its present-day segregation doesn’t really match up against its formerly redlined zones. In 2019, <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/gentrification-philadelphia-african-american-latino-investment-neighborhood-20190320.html">a study by the National Community Reinvestment Coalition</a> found that seven cities account for almost half of all the gentrification in the U.S., and by their metrics, Philadelphia was one of the cities where gentrification was most rampant.</p>

<p>In recent years, it’s become popular among some Democrats to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/americas-formerly-redlines-areas-changed-so-must-solutions/">tout proposals</a> that will remedy segregation caused by redlining. But Taylor told us that these measures often fail to account for how the maps have changed over time. For instance, in Philadelphia, young white people have been able to move into historically Black neighborhoods and buy homes by <a href="https://revealnews.org/article/gentrification-became-low-income-lending-laws-unintended-consequence/">using programs</a> associated with the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which was intended to remedy the damage of redlining. In fact, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/half-century-federal-oversight-segregated-neighborhoods-pervasive-abc/story?id=82678035">per an ABC News analysis</a>, it’s now easier for white people than people of color to buy homes in historically nonwhite neighborhoods. In 2019, 65 percent of the 347,000 white homebuyers who applied for mortgages in mostly nonwhite neighborhoods in the country’s largest metro areas were approved, compared with 56 percent of 715,000 nonwhite homebuyers who received a loan in those same neighborhoods.</p>
<p>What’s more, Taylor said, simply encouraging homeownership <a href="https://whyy.org/articles/philly-just-challenged-an-infamous-slumlord-to-a-legal-death-match-and-won/">in neighborhoods like East Germantown</a>, where the housing stock is old and dilapidated, could saddle Black Americans with debt. Without being able to fund repairs or escape long, predatory mortgages, these programs could exacerbate the housing crisis and push more Black people out of their neighborhoods.</p>
<p>“There’s no money to be made in affordable housing, and so all the building that is happening now are million-dollar condos, because that’s where the money is,” Taylor said.</p>
<p>Some 40 years after the first redlining map was drawn, redlining was banned under the Fair Housing Act of 1968. But in many ways, HOLC and the Federal Housing Administration had already written the textbook for racist real estate practices.</p>
<p>“[The Fair Housing Act of 1968] doesn’t roll back or undo or make amends for 50 years of housing discrimination that had gone on up to that point,” said Winling, the Virginia Tech historian involved in the Mapping Inequality project. “It’s going to take probably another 80 or 90 years of vigorous enforcement and vigorous remediation to undo that legacy.”</p>
<p>The legacy of redlining extends far beyond housing segregation, too. Its impact can be seen today in minority neighborhoods’ access to <a href="https://ncrc.org/holc-health/">health care</a>, poorer <a href="https://www.edworkingpapers.com/sites/default/files/ai21-363.pdf">educational opportunties</a>, and increased risk of climate change, as many of these areas are more prone to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-flood-risk-redlining/">flooding</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html">extreme heat</a>. Without a serious confrontation of its lasting generational damage, the racial segregation caused by redlining isn’t going anywhere either.</p>
<p>“I look at it as: Redlining happened. It was an important part of American history,” Perry said. “And we must reckon with the behaviors and the outcomes in ways that never discount what redlining did. And again, it has different stories for different cities, but redlining is a part of that story. It just is.”</p>

<p>Redlining maps used in this project were originally drawn by the now-defunct Home Owners’ Loan Corporation (HOLC) from 1935-40 and downloaded from the <a href="https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/redlining">Mapping Inequality</a> project. Individual HOLC zones that fall within the same metropolitan area were grouped according to <a href="https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/metro-micro/geographies/reference-files/2020/delineation-files/list1_2020.xls">census micro- or metropolitan area definitions</a>.6 A small number of HOLC zones fractionally overlapped in source map shapefiles; these overlaps were carved out of the geographically larger zone.7</p>
<p>Population and race/ethnicity data comes from the 2020 U.S. decennial census. Population counts were aggregated from census blocks, which are the smallest geographic census units and offer the most precision when matching census data to other geographic shapes. HOLC zones were matched to census data by first determining which census blocks geographically intersected with each zone. Data from all matching blocks was then weighted by the proportion of the block’s total area that intersects with that HOLC zone and summed to estimate the 2020 demographic makeup of each HOLC zone.</p>
<p>The surrounding area for each metropolitan area’s HOLC map was computed by adding a 10 percent buffer radius to the combined zones in that metropolitan area.8 Surrounding area population totals were then computed by summing census-block population data, weighted by the proportion of each block’s total area contained within the surrounding area’s border.</p>
<p>For each metropolitan area’s HOLC map, a <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/technical-appendix#footnote34_cnxakh3">location quotient (LQ)</a> — a small-area measure of segregation that specifically compares one racial/ethnic group’s proportion in a granular geography to its proportion in a larger surrounding geography — was calculated for combined A-, B-, C- and D-rated zones for each racial/ethnic group. An LQ above 1 for a given racial group indicates overrepresentation in that HOLC zone compared with the broader surrounding area, and values below 1 indicate underrepresentation. A metropolitan area’s HOLC zones were defined as segregated for a minority racial/ethnic group if: (1) its LQ in D-rated zones was greater than 1 (suggesting this group was overrepresented in redlined areas); (2) its LQ in D-rated zones was greater than its LQ in A-rated zones (suggesting this group was more represented in redlined areas than in greenlined areas); and (3) its LQ in A-rated zones was smaller than the white population’s LQ in A-rated zones (suggesting this group was not more represented in greenlined areas than the white population).</p>
<p>Population density dots were generated for each racial/ethnic group within a census block, with each dot representing one person. Dots were placed randomly within a census block and do not represent exact locations but rather the total population of a given race/ethnicity in that block. White, Black and Asian data excludes those who indicated Hispanic or Latino ethnicity. Hispanic/Latino data includes all who indicated Hispanic or Latino ethnicity, regardless of race. Other race data includes all population counts that did not fall under white, Black, Asian or Latino. The Albers Equal-Area Conic projection, which guarantees areas on one map are equivalent to areas on another map, was used for all maps and spatial calculations.</p>

Ted Cruz of Texas denounced Biden’s promise as “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-joins-republicans-slamming-bidens-vow-black-woman/story?id=82583224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offensive</a>” while GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/gop-sen-wicker-compares-biden-s-supreme-court-pledge-affirmative-n1288211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preemptively dismissed</a> the prospective nominee as benefitting from a racially discriminatory “quota.” On Fox News, Sean Hannity <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/hannity-biden-black-female-scotus-pick-identity-politics-steroids-unconstitutional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slammed</a> Biden’s pledge as “identity politics on steroids.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/reagan-example-republicans-have-conveniently-forgotten-n1288233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-fox-news-biden-black-woman-supreme-court-1293781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">astute</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/04/1078358077/republicans-take-issue-with-bidens-pledge-to-pick-a-black-woman-for-supreme-cour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/biden-supreme-court-nominee-smear-campaign/621408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promptly</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidents-factored-race-gender-ethnicity-scotus-picks/story?id=82585364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> that Republicans haven’t objected to prior presidents’ pledges to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court. There was no equivalent outcry, for instance, when President Ronald Reagan vowed to appoint <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/10/15/reagan-pledges-he-would-name-a-woman-to-the-supreme-court/844817dc-27aa-4f5d-8e4f-0ab3a5e76865/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first woman to the Supreme Court</a> during the 1980 presidential campaign — a promise he fulfilled the following year by nominating Sandra Day O’Connor. Nor was their condemnation of former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/20/trump-vows-to-nominate-a-woman-for-us-supreme-court-vacancy-within-a-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledge</a> to nominate a woman to fill the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat in September 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Stanford professor and FiveThirtyEight contributor, Hakeem Jefferson, <a href="https://twitter.com/hakeemjefferson/status/1487448727870590979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>, “Conservatives didn’t get upset when Trump promised to nominate a woman to the bench because the qualifier ‘white’ was simply implied.” He later <a href="https://twitter.com/hakeemjefferson/status/1487841389022879745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that it’s the misogynoir, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2020/09/22/misogynoir-the-unique-discrimination-that-black-women-face/?sh=9c858a256ef6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique biases Black women experience</a>, not the pledge, that is the problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling data certainly seems to support Jefferson’s argument. Take, for example, Republican responses to the two YouGov polling questions about the importance of nominating a woman and the importance of nominating a <em>Black</em> woman to fill vacated SCOTUS seats in 2020 and 2022, respectively.</p>

</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">The chart above shows that more than half of Republicans and over three-quarters of Democrats thought it was important to have a female justice replace Ginsburg in a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/o6p3vjhvnt/20200924_yahoo_coronavirus_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2020 YouGov/Yahoo Poll</a> conducted a few days before Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to fill her seat. But while a similarly large share of Democrats said it’s very or somewhat important to have a Black woman replace Breyer in a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/01/26/ed5f0/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2022 YouGov survey</a>, only 13 percent of Republicans said the same about Biden nominating a Black woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, there are other factors that may be driving Republicans’ divergent responses in that chart besides including the word “Black” before woman in the 2022 polling. Trump’s 2020 nominee, after all, was filling a Supreme Court seat held for over a quarter-century by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feminist icon</a>, who was only the second woman to ever serve on the high court. That could have easily amplified the importance of nominating a woman more than replacing Breyer, a male justice.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the January 2022 poll mentions Biden&rsquo;s pledge before asking about the importance of nominating a Black woman; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;political science research&lt;/a&gt; has found that providing such information about the president&rsquo;s positions often increases opposition from the other party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there are good reasons to nonetheless suspect that Republicans are uniquely opposed to presidential pledges in support of African Americans — especially when they’re made by Democratic presidents. In fact, a similar pattern emerged in a <a href="https://doi.roper.center/?doi=10.25940/ROPER-31095452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2009 CNN/ORC poll</a>, which asked respondents to rate the importance of race and gender in then-President Barack Obama’s forthcoming pick to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice David Souter’s retirement. Just 14 percent of Republicans said it was important Obama nominate an African American to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, <em>both</em> Democrats and Republicans were nearly twice as likely to say it was important for Obama to pick a woman than they were to say it was important for him to nominate an African American to the Supreme Court, as you can see in the chart below. But unlike Democrats who have experienced a sharp uptick in the share who think a Black person should be nominated to the court since 2009, the share of Republicans who agree is practically unchanged.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="In 2009, both parties prioritized a female over a Black justice" aria-label="Split Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-shV50" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/shV50/4/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="235"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is yet another reminder of the <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/racing-apart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarkable shift partisans’ racial attitudes have undergone in the past decade</a>. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-and-democrats-increasingly-agree-on-the-protests-but-not-why-people-are-protesting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-2020-could-shape-the-conversation-on-race-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a> that the share of white Democrats who view systemic racism as an impediment to Black progress has skyrocketed in recent years. It’s no surprise, then, that the <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/new-polls-most-americans-support-biden-nominating-black-woman-to-supreme-court-but-only-19-percent-of-republicans/https:/www.mediaite.com/news/new-polls-most-americans-support-biden-nominating-black-woman-to-supreme-court-but-only-19-percent-of-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming majority of Democrats (82 percent) support</a> “President Biden’s plan to nominate a Black woman to the United States Supreme Court” — especially when Democratic leadership frames the nomination as combatting the same structural biases that have excluded African American women from the high court throughout the nation’s history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans, meanwhile, have moved in the opposite direction on race. As I wrote in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics-explains-the-fight-over-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous piece for FiveThirtyEight</a>, GOP politics are increasingly animated by the belief that anti-white discrimination is as big of a problem in American society as biases against racial and ethnic minorities. Those views helped <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/03/how-political-science-helps-explain-the-rise-of-trump-the-role-of-white-identity-and-grievances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fuel Trump’s rise within the party</a>; and they factor heavily into conservatives’ mischaracterization of critical race theory, an academic framework that<a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> helps explain how <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racism permeates American institutions</a>, as an anti-white “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existential threat to the United States</a>.” <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9uqg6clnvr/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Few Trump voters (19 percent) approve</a> of Biden’s pledge — especially when prominent Republicans frame it as a racially discriminatory appointment of an unqualified justice who doesn’t “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vpey/gop-senator-thinks-bidens-scotus-nominee-wont-know-a-law-book-from-a-j-crew-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know a law book from a J. Crew catalog</a>.” That is, of course, patently false as FiveThirtyEight’s Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux and Elena Mejía wrote in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-bidens-appointees-can-tell-us-about-his-supreme-court-nominee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent analysis of Biden’s judicial appointees so far</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But understanding the power racial grievances have in GOP politics today goes a long way in understanding why Republicans are so strongly opposed to Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. As Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/02/02/republicans-cant-agree-on-a-scotus-strategy-00004536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a>, “I want a nominee who’s not going to try to rewrite the Constitution every other Thursday to try to advance a ‘woke agenda.’” And undoubtedly, the race, gender and partisanship of Biden’s prospective pick all intersect with one another to heighten these Republican fears of “wokeness” run amok in ways that nominees of other identities almost certainly would not.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Are there really more Americans identifying as Republicans than Democrats now? For decades, more Americans <a href="https://electionstudies.org/resources/anes-guide/top-tables/?id=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have tended to identify</a> as Democrats than as Republicans, even if the gap has sometimes been small. But in January, Gallup found that <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans had taken the lead</a> in party ID during the last three months of 2021: On average, 47 percent identified as a Republican or said they leaned toward the GOP, while 42 percent identified as a Democrat or leaned toward the Democratic Party. Given we’re headed into what will be a competitive midterm election year, this finding <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/25/opinion/gallup-poll-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sparked a flurry</a> of <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/18/1073774921/americans-political-party-preferences-shifted-to-republicans-in-recent-months" target="_blank" rel="noopener">headlines in the days</a> following <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/us-shifts-party-preference-from-democratic-to-republican-in-2021-with-gop-holding-largest-lead-since-1995" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the release of Gallup’s report</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it’s still too soon to know whether more Americans are actually identifying as Republicans. Gallup’s finding could portend a lasting change, or it could also be a short-term reaction to an unpopular Democratic president, or it could be an artifact of lower response rates by Democrats frustrated with bad news for their party — or it could relate to all of the above. After all, political science research has found that <a href="https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-72?print=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an individual’s party identification can fluctuate</a>. That said, party ID also tends to be pretty stable in the long run, such that we’d expect changes across the population to be gradual.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To that point, there are two ways of looking at Gallup’s party ID data: quarterly and annually. In the quarterly data, you can see that party ID is volatile. In general, it favors Democrats, but there are numerous spikes in the data as well as instances when Republicans have had the advantage. In the yearly data, meanwhile, it’s easier to see that more Americans have consistently identified as Democrats than Republicans, although there were periods in the early 2000s and early 2010s when party ID was more evenly matched — perhaps not coincidentally, those years featured strong Republican electoral performances — and in 1991 when Republicans even held an advantage, thanks in part to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/gallup/234971/george-bush-retrospective.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very popular GOP president</a> in the White House.</p>

Annual Gallup data suggests that the most recent quarterly numbers might have been a blip and that we should expect Democratic party ID <a href="http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/unpublished/kaplan.park.gelman.110728.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to rebound soon</a>. After all, in the last 30 years, Gallup’s annual data has found, on average, that 47 percent of Americans identified as Democrats versus 42 percent as Republicans (including independents who leaned toward each party). Then again, it’s possible that this quarterly data is pointing to a longer-lasting gain in party ID for Republicans, as was the case in the early 2000s and 2010s. This could have potentially major consequences for the upcoming midterm election, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912918784215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">research published in 2018</a>, political scientists Patrick Tucker, Jacob Montgomery and Steven Smith used longitudinal data from the <a href="https://wc.wustl.edu/american-panel-survey" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Panel Survey</a> to study partisan identification from 2011 to 2016, finding that changes in presidential approval and favorability of the two parties often preceded changes in party affiliation in the short term, particularly among Americans who did not have strong ties to their party. Considering that <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s job approval</a> has suffered in recent months, it could be that the short-term changes we see in Gallup’s data indeed indicate the electorate’s movement away from the Democratic Party. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Along the same lines, <a href="https://law.marquette.edu/poll/about-the-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Charles Franklin</a>, the director of the Marquette Law School poll, recently analyzed <a href="https://pollsandvotes.com/?p=217" target="_blank" rel="noopener">movement in party ID across a number of major pollsters</a>, and he broadly found a decrease in those identifying as Democratic — although not the same degree of swing toward the GOP as in Gallup’s quarterly data. However, it is worth noting that Franklin was looking at party ID that did <em>not</em> include independents that lean toward a party, because many pollsters don’t publish party ID data with leaners. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, that study by Tucker, Montgomery and Smith also found that changes in party ID tended to revert over time as voters’ evaluations of the parties and the president stabilize, so the initial movement we see in Gallup’s data may not last. In fact, Gallup found the two parties were running close to even in December, perhaps suggesting that the shift toward the GOP was already abating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This tendency for people to shift their party ID in the short term only to then <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/08/04/voters-rarely-switch-parties-but-recent-shifts-further-educational-racial-divergence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revert back</a> is evident in the Pew Research Center’s party ID numbers, which are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">very similar overall to Gallup’s yearly numbers</a>. For instance, between September 2018 and July 2020, Pew found that about one in five Americans in their <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/our-methods/u-s-surveys/the-american-trends-panel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Trends Panel</a> made some change to their party identification, but nearly nine in 10 identified or leaned toward the same party in 2020 as in 2018. In other words, nearly half of those who had switched parties ultimately switched back.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes those who switched between the parties, and those who switched to independent and then switched back to their previous party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And of course, as is the case anytime we’re talking about polling, there are methodological differences among pollsters that can further muddy the waters of how Americans see themselves in the political landscape. As Marquette Law School’s Franklin noted, differences in question wording can contribute to differences in partisan identification; Gallup’s party ID question <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/15370/party-affiliation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">asks respondents</a> how they identify “as of today,” for instance, whereas <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21182470-220027-survey-1-20-22-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some other pollsters</a> ask <a href="https://poll.qu.edu/images/polling/us/us01122022_demos_ubjw88.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how respondents</a> identify “generally speaking.” And in a <a href="https://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~jcampbel/documents/AbramsonOstromAPSR1991.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1991 study</a>, political scientists Paul Abramson and Charles Ostrom found that from 1952 to 1988, Gallup’s version of the question did produce more volatility in party ID than other pollsters’ versions of this question. That may still be the case, considering that Franklin found smaller shifts among other pollsters’ versions of this question in January.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s also possible that the large swing in party ID toward the GOP that Gallup observed could be partly due to Democratic-leaning Americans responding at lower rates. Democrats might have been more discouraged by what’s going on in Washington, what with Biden’s dismal approval rating and Democrats having failed to pass their much-ballyhooed social spending and voting rights legislation. There’s even a term for this — <a href="https://www.formpl.us/blog/response-non-response-bias#:~:text=Non%2Dresponse%20bias%20is%20a,for%20the%20lack%20of%20response." target="_blank" rel="noopener">nonresponse bias</a> — and we’ve seen it happen before: Lower response rates among Republican-leaning voters ahead of the 2020 election <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/13/politics/2020-polling-error-research/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may have contributed</a> to the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-death-of-polling-is-greatly-exaggerated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">polling error</a> that underestimated GOP support. But it’s also possible that some pollsters are weighting their polls in ways that could diminish the impact of nonresponse bias or other short-term factors. For instance, YouGov <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/idsbkknia1/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weights its polls to match</a> the 2016 and 2020 election results, which means that while they <a href="https://twitter.com/gelliottmorris/status/1485632944463036424?s=20&amp;t=fMW-rcvwguf44mK78i2wjg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also found a Republican-leaning trend</a> in party ID across 2021, the magnitude of that shift was much, much smaller.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YouGov conducts online polls using &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/06/what-are-nonprobability-surveys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;nonprobability samples&lt;/a&gt;. This means their samples aren’t totally random, but it’s possible their approach of using past presidential results to weight results may be less error-prone than other methods. For instance, a 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/methods/2016/05/02/assessing-the-accuracy-of-online-nonprobability-surveys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Pew study&lt;/a&gt; compared the error of different nonprobability surveys, and it found that a sample weighted by party ID — similar to YouGov’s practice of weighting to past presidential vote — produced the smallest amount of polling error across a number of known benchmarks. But Pew did flag some concerns regarding online pollsters using such approaches — specifically, if done poorly, weighting by a predetermined result could unduly influence other findings in the survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, it’s probably too early to say how much of the Republican shift in partisan identification is real, or how long it will last. However, it’s also not clear whether this particular data point tells us much more about the electorate than we already know from Biden’s job approval, generic congressional ballot polling and other political polls. In their study, Abramson and Ostrom did show that party identification polls were moderately predictive of electoral outcomes for the House and presidency, but direct measures such as the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-generic-ballot-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generic congressional ballot</a> and head-to-head polling are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-best-tool-for-predicting-midterm-elections-doesnt-show-a-republican-wave-but-history-is-on-the-gops-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still much better indicators</a> of what to expect in elections. All things considered, this may be just one more data point that directs us toward what we already expect: Things are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/some-early-clues-about-how-the-midterms-will-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking pretty tough</a> for the Democrats in November.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-paragraph="main">We are approaching the two-year mark of living with the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. Though the omicron wave is receding, the virus will unlikely just disappear, and people are unhappy and angry — about COVID-19 and plenty else. In surveys, <a href="https://www.dailywire.com/news/record-number-of-americans-report-being-unhappy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more Americans</a> are saying they’re unhappy in their own lives, about two-thirds think the country is on the <a href="https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/direction_of_country-902.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrong track</a>, and Biden is <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a percentage point away</a> from Trump’s record for being the least popular postwar president at this point in his term. In this installment of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/politics-podcast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a>, the crew discusses how Americans are feeling and which types of COVID-19 restrictions they do and don&#8217;t support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The podcast also covers some big recent developments in the redistricting process happening around the country now. New York signed into law a map that aggressively advantages Democrats, and elsewhere, state and federal courts have struck down maps they consider gerrymanders.</p>

<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">For a few years now, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/11/18/934631994/bidens-win-shows-rural-urban-divide-has-grown-since-2016" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly Republican</a> politics of rural America has struck a nerve for Democrats who call it home. But in the summer of 2020, when tens of thousands of people <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/03/us/george-floyd-protests-crowd-size.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">swarmed the streets</a> to protest racism and police violence, tensions were particularly high between one of those progressive residents and a female neighbor. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“She approached me in my driveway and said she had some information for me,” Rob B., a 56-year-old who lives in rural Arizona, recalled of the encounter. “She informed me that she had purchased a pistol from the local gun shop for $75 to protect herself because the ‘news’ was reporting that antifa and [Black Lives Matter] were going to start ‘raiding’ rural towns.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rob B., who prefers to use only his first name and last initial out of privacy concerns, said he tried to convince his neighbor, a Republican, that no protesters were coming, which he said seemed to relieve her even if she wasn’t entirely convinced. And of course, despite some conservative social media accounts <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/antifa-rumors-spread-local-social-media-no-evidence-n1222486" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushing versions of this story</a> at the time, no one “bad” did come to their town. But it was around then that Rob B. said he started to notice an explosion of <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2020/06/09/the-short-fraught-history-of-the-thin-blue-line-american-flag-309767" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thin-blue-line bumper stickers and flags</a> — a symbol originally meant to signify support for law enforcement. “They were suddenly everywhere,” he said. And as a speck of blue in a red political sea, he felt completely outnumbered. “Even though Biden supporters live here, too, the Trump people are more outspoken, louder, bigger and in complete excess.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the one hand, it’s not that surprising Rob B.’s neighbors are <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2016-election/trump-other-conservatives-embrace-blue-lives-matter-movement-n615156" target="_blank" rel="noopener">far more conservative</a> than he is. For the past fifteen years or so, rural America has <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily trended red</a>, with former President Trump winning rural voters over President Biden in 2020 by more than 30 percentage points, according to the <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a>. In fact, given Republicans’ <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0002716217712696" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued dominance</a> in rural America, Democrats have largely abandoned trying to win voters who reside there, opting instead to <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/democrats-rural-voters-midterm-elections-2024-culture-2021-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focus their resources</a> on bluer cities and suburbs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This political maneuvering was driven in part by the fact that the U.S. <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1948550621994000#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has increasingly sorted itself</a> along geographic lines, with Republicans living in more rural areas <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2014/06/12/section-3-political-polarization-and-personal-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and Democrats in cities</a>. This has changed how the two parties compete for votes, but another effect is that many of the rural Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters I spoke with feel like outsiders — or even unsafe — in their own homes. Many reported believing that their party had mostly given up on campaigning in their parts of the country.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To that end, I wanted to better understand why some rural residents vote Democratic when nearly everyone around them votes Republican. I also wanted to discuss how comfortable they feel discussing their political views with their neighbors. To do this, I spoke with five rural-dwelling voters who are either Democrats or overwhelmingly support Democratic policies. I learned that most feel they have drastically differing political priorities from their neighbors, while others feel they <em>must</em> keep their beliefs to themselves for fear of violence or retribution. And lastly, some told me they don’t currently have the means, or don’t want, to leave Trump country — rather, they wish Democrats would start treating their hometowns the same way Democrats treat battleground states.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I have yet to see a sign for any Democrat running for office in my area or my district for 2022,” said Ian C., a 32-year-old living in Georgia who uses gender-neutral pronouns and prefers to be identified without their surname. “It really doesn’t seem like Democrats care about this area too much, even though they should. I think there are a lot of working-class people here who would resonate with the right message.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At least in the short-term, though, Ian C.’s wishes might be futile. One of the reasons Democrats often fail to seriously contest — let alone win — state-legislative and congressional seats in much of rural America is because the issues that animate <em>their </em>base can be off-putting to many rural voters. Many of the Democrats and Democratic-leaning voters I spoke with said that the issues they prioritized — like climate change, election integrity and racial justice — weren’t top of mind for their neighbors. And in rare cases, confrontations erupted when my interviewees had tried to start discussions about policy or political issues important to them.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1506" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-324888" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As the chart above shows, rural Americans, on average, tend to hold more conservative views than their urban counterparts. For example, on immigration, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/urban-suburban-and-rural-residents-views-on-key-social-and-political-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew found in 2018</a> that Republicans and Republican-leaners living in rural areas were more likely than their urban and suburban counterparts to see a growing immigrant population as a threat to “traditional American customs and values.” And on racial justice issues, rural residents were the <em>least </em>likely to think that white Americans benefit from societal advantages that Black citizens don’t have. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But policy isn’t the only arena where rural Democrats and their neighbors are at odds. Views toward Trump have been another dividing line. In that same 2018 survey, Pew found that rural Republicans and Republican-leaners were more likely than their suburban and urban counterparts to have “very warm” feelings toward the former president — which has led some Democrats to feel they have a moral obligation to call out perceived injustices from Trump and his supporters, even if they’re not being provoked.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For example, the day after the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/live-blog/reflections-on-the-jan-6-insurrection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol</a>, Rob B. said there were two separate occasions when he called people in his neighborhood either a “Nazi” or a “traitor” after he saw them donning “Make America Great Again” hats. He said his knee-jerk reaction wasn’t because these people merely supported Trump, but because, in his telling, “they were making a point to flaunt support the day after one of the worst days in America’s history.” To me, he compared these MAGA-hat-wearing neighbors to “folks who make a point to go out in full NRA garb the day after a major shooting in the U.S. — something I definitely also see here.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Camellia El-Antably of Wyoming, 47, also felt she needed to say something to a neighbor who used to sell guns near where she worked. “Shortly after a major shooting, I told her something to the effect of ‘I believe that gun control is important.’ She got really angry and thought I was trying to denigrate her business or something,” she said to me. “Finally, I wrote her a note apologizing, and after that, it was OK. We’re definitely not friends, but we’re not enemies either.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the most part, though, these political differences left many of the people I spoke with believing it no longer made sense to talk politics to their neighbors. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“A while back, a couple of friends and I agreed that we would never change each other’s minds,” said Carol D., a 71-year-old Texan who wants to use only her first name and last initial out of privacy concerns. “It’s a little awkward because one of them is crazy about Trump, and I lost respect for her because of that. To be honest, I wouldn’t be surprised if she felt the same way about me.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it wasn’t always like this. For the rural Democrats I spoke with, the turning point was the <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/10/31/the-republican-party-has-lurched-towards-populism-and-illiberalism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican Party</a>’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-senators-and-representatives-vote-in-favor-of-democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing illiberalism</a> in recent years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“In the 20 years we’ve been here, there was a dramatic change starting in 2015, when Trump announced his run for president,” said Donald Wright, a 52-year-old Virginian. “I think often about how much of it was under the surface versus what people now feel and are able to express freely. So maybe the feelings were there pre-Trump, but the more blatant hostility wasn’t always there.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, part of that perceived hostility likely stems from the fact that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/04/30/opinion/politics/bubble-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">geographic political segregation</a> leaves Democrats living in red areas (and Republicans in blue ones) feeling more out of place than ever before. And another part could be the fact that the most staunch conservatives are <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/faith-and-flag-conservatives/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more likely to live in rural areas</a>. Worryingly, what it means to be a conservative is also increasingly tangled up in a lack of respect for democracy.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1512" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-324889" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Samuels.PoliticalOutliers.0207-2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As a result of current attitudes within the GOP, some rural Democrats now feel both alone in their politics and that they need to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/11/09/the-democratic-coalition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat falsehoods</a> that their own party consists primarily of socialists and those with far-left politics. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As a progressive in these areas, it is mostly about trying to normalize that we aren’t all three-headed child cannibals but rather actual neighbors and parts of the community,” Wright said. “We aren’t going to be directly changing hearts and minds, but we can hope to help break down stereotypes.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite what many described as a currently stressful living situation, most people I spoke to said they couldn’t see themselves leaving anytime soon. They listed several reasons for this: owning a home, having a steady in-person job and/or having children currently in school. They also haven’t given up hope that Democrats will eventually show interest in their neck of the woods. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The Democratic Party is not very strong here,” El-Antably told me. “It’s very hard for them to field enough candidates, and as a result, there’s lots of times when Republicans run for statewide office unopposed or the Democrat running is weak, unable to raise enough money or doesn’t run a strong campaign.” She added that this had led some of her Democratic friends to register as Republicans to vote in a GOP primary so they could “vote for the least-worst Republican.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The imminent problem for Democrats, though, is that rural America has recently drifted further from them than urban America has moved away<em> </em>from Republicans. From 1999 to 2019, urban areas moved 9 points toward Democrats, while rural areas swung 13 points toward Republicans, according to <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2020/06/02/democratic-edge-in-party-identification-narrows-slightly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Pew survey released in 2020</a>. (The suburbs remained essentially tied over that same span of time.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That means the Democratic Party will surely need to expand their base — which could include actively campaigning in redder parts of the nation. And if the Democrats I spoke to had one message they wanted to convey to their party, it’s to not give up on them and to take rural America seriously even if there’s not an election around the corner. Ian C., for example, noticed that Democrats stopped making regular campaign stops in Georgia after the party <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/01/06/us/georgia-election-results" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nabbed two competitive Senate seats</a> last year. “I’m not a politician, but it seems like common sense: If you want to focus on winning Georgia again and keeping it blue, you have to invest in this,” they said. “The Democratic Party only cares about you if you’re a battleground or if you’re marginally safe. And that’s frustrating. It’s part of the reason why I often contemplate the point of voting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Ian C. told me, Georgia is their home: “It’s cheap here, and it’s quiet. I bought my first home here.” And even though it might be easy to assume that Democrats living in rural America don’t mean much electorally, since their votes are often overshadowed by Republicans, the residents I spoke to were steadfast that their party shouldn’t throw in the towel with rural America. “Moving won’t change the fact the county is divided, and God forbid, the worst happens. We have to rely on each other when things do happen,” they said. “We have to be willing to try.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Did you tune into (or are you currently watching) the opening ceremonies for the Winter Olympics Friday morning? Did you even realize the opening ceremonies were happening? If not, you’re not alone. Polling shows enthusiasm for the Games is muted, and while the Winter Games <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/en/SB-Blogs/COVID19-OpEds/2022/02/02-Erickson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are typically not as popular</a> as Summer Games in the U.S., the fact that the Olympics are being held in China doesn’t help. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">American interest in the Games is lower than it has been in the past. According to an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/us-and-global-public-attitudes-2022-beijing-winter-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos poll</a> conducted ​​Dec. 23–Jan. 7, 42 percent of adults said they were interested in the upcoming Games, compared with 55 percent ahead of the last Winter Olympics, in 2018. Just 45 percent of American adults said they planned to watch some or a lot of the Olympics, according to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/31/beijing-olympics-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 25-27. That’s roughly the same as the percentage who said they planned to watch the Summer Games in Tokyo last year, though that marked a record low for viewership intent according to the pollster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reasons for that dip are mysterious and multifaceted. Of those who told Morning Consult that they don’t plan to watch, 65 percent said it was because they aren’t interested in the events, and 57 percent said it’s because they aren’t interested in the athletes (13 percent, meanwhile, blamed the time zone difference). There are likely a number of underlying factors provoking this lack of interest: For one thing, the last Olympic Games were just six months ago, so there may be a bit of event fatigue since the Games are typically spaced out every two years. There’s also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/sports/tv-ratings-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a general decline</a> in TV ratings for sports in recent years. And, as mentioned above, the Winter Olympics tend to be a tougher sell for American audiences compared with the Summer Games. Meanwhile, 40 percent in the Morning Consult poll said they don’t plan to watch the Olympics this year because they are opposed to China hosting the Games, and 31 percent cited it as a “major” reason.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a politics column, so let’s focus on that stat a bit. Americans’ views toward China have become more chilly in recent years: a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey last February</a> found 67 percent of U.S. adults felt very or somewhat “cold” toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Among Republicans, those feelings were stronger, with 79 percent of Republicans feeling the chill. In a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/31/more-adults-approve-than-disapprove-of-u-s-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-few-have-heard-much-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted Jan. 10-17 this year, Americans were more likely to say that, on balance, they consider China a competitor rather than an enemy, but among Republicans that trend reversed: 52 percent of Republicans said China was an enemy, compared with 40 percent who considered the nation a competitor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The choice to host the Games in Beijing has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/20/1074500316/as-the-olympics-near-activists-criticize-chinas-alleged-human-rights-violations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious due to China’s human rights record</a>, including <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/19/break-their-lineage-break-their-roots/chinas-crimes-against-humanity-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abuse and violence</a> against ethnic and religious minorities in the country, such as predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In response to the criticism, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/06/2022-winter-olympics-biden-announces-diplomatic-boycott-beijing/8837884002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Biden administration</a> chose not to send an official delegation to the Games (as did <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nations-holding-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-games/story?id=82461768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of other</a> nations), a kind of “diplomatic boycott.” In a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/2/2/the-us-diplomatic-boycott-against-the-beijing-olympics-is-popular-with-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted by Data for Progress</a> from Dec. 15-18 (shortly after the boycott was announced), 67 percent of likely voters supported the decision not to send a delegation, and a plurality of American adults either somewhat or strongly approved of the boycott, according to the January Pew survey. But that Pew survey also showed just 9 percent of adults had heard a lot about it. In fact, 45 percent hadn’t heard anything about the boycott at all. Among those who had heard a lot about it, 69 percent approved of the decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Americans want U.S. corporations to take a stand as well. When asked whether they think “companies should withdraw their advertisements for the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in response to human rights violations by the Chinese government,” 54 percent of U.S. adults said probably or definitely yes, according to a <a href="https://static.grid.news/NationalTrackingPolls/2201140_topline_GRID_BEIJING_OLYMPICS_Adults_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 22-23. Just 34 percent of U.S. adults somewhat or strongly support brands or companies sponsoring the Olympics, according to a separate <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/01/olympic-sponsors-china-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 29-31, while 58 percent would support brands pulling out of the Games. However, brands might be able to win support simply by issuing a statement condemning China’s actions: 55 percent of U.S. adults said they would support such a move. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, though, Americans still stand behind athletes who chose to attend the Games: 63 percent said they support U.S. athletes participating in the Games, according to that Grid/Morning Consult poll. It captures a sentiment that has been commonly expressed in the run-up to the Games: It’s fair to criticize the International Olympic Committee for selecting China as a host, and it’s fair to criticize China for its history. But many argue there’s no need to punish the athletes, for whom the chance to compete at the highest level is often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. One that, judging by the polling, many Americans won’t see.</p>



<h2 id="other-polling-bites"><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to a Jan. 21-24 Data for Progress poll of likely voters, 58 percent said they would support the Biden administration <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/27/a-majority-of-voters-support-biden-striking-a-deal-with-russia-to-avoid-war-in-ukraine">striking a diplomatic deal with Russia</a> to avoid war with Ukraine. Democrats, in particular, favored diplomacy, with 71 percent in favor. A slight plurality (46 percent) of Republicans agreed. However, when Americans were asked in a Jan. 28-29 ABC News/Ipsos poll about the U.S. <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/president-biden-continues-lose-ground-american-public">sending troops to eastern Europe</a> to try to discourage Russia from invading Ukraine, respondents were split: 38 percent said they opposed sending troops, 29 percent supported it and 32 percent said they didn’t know.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans’ views of the economy are still mostly pessimistic. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx">Jan. 3-16 poll by Gallup</a>, 67 percent said they thought the economy was getting worse versus 29 percent who said it was getting better. They did find one bright spot, though: the job market. A 43 percent plurality predicted that the unemployment rate would decrease over the next six months. In addition, 72 percent said now was a good time to get a quality job — among the highest figures the pollster has recorded since it began tracking the question in 2001.</li></ul><ul><li>The majority of parents of school-age children (67 percent) believe that pandemic-related educational disruptions have put their children <a href="https://civicscience.com/majority-of-parents-say-kids-are-behind-academically-right-now-except-for-this-group/">somewhat or very behind in school</a>, according to a Jan. 19-26 CivicScience poll. And while children from higher-income families <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-020-09782-0">generally perform better in school</a>, parents who made more than $125,000 a year were more likely (80 percent) to believe the pandemic put their children behind educationally than those who made less than $35,000 a year (65 percent).</li></ul><ul><li>While there’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">widespread support</a> for the Biden administration’s decision to mail free at-home COVID-19 tests to anyone who wants one, fewer than half (47 percent) were able to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/31/who-requested-free-home-covid-tests-government">successfully request one</a>. In a Jan. 22-25 Economist/YouGov poll, fully vaccinated adults were much more likely to have successfully requested an at-home COVID-19 test (54 percent) compared with those who say they will not get the jab (27 percent). Instead, a majority (70 percent) of unvaccinated adults said they hadn’t tried to request one.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans are largely satisfied with their own lives but dissatisfied with the direction of the country as a whole. Eighty-five percent said they were very or somewhat satisfied with how things were going in their personal lives, while just 17 percent said the same for the United States, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx">according to Gallup</a>. People with an annual household income of $100,000 or more and those who attend religious services weekly were most likely to report satisfaction with their personal lives (at 94 and 92 percent, respectively). While nonwhite people (27 percent) and Democrats (30 percent) were the most likely to be satisfied with the direction of the country, just 12 percent of white people and just 4 percent of Republicans said the same.</li></ul><h2 id="biden-approval"><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

<p data-paragraph="main">Latino voters swung by <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8 percentage points</a> toward then-President Donald Trump in the last election, the largest swing of any racial or ethnic group in the electorate. Last April, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/politics-podcast-will-trumps-gains-with-latino-voters-last/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FiveThirtyEight Politics podcast</a> spoke with the team at <a href="https://www.equisresearch.us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Equis Research</a>, a political data firm focusing on Latino voters, about <em>what</em> exactly happened. As to the question of <em>why</em> voters swung, the answer was, in large part, that we needed more data. Now we have more data! In this installment of the podcast, Equis&#8217;s co-founders share <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/61b7e8e75c74f5558036268b/1639442667560/Post-Mortem+Part+Two+FINAL+Dec+13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what they found</a>.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>UPDATE (Feb. 7, 5:43 p.m. Eastern):</strong> On Feb. 7, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21a375_d18f.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinstated</a> the congressional map passed by Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature for the 2022 elections, pending a final decision on the merits of the case at a later date. The court’s ultimate ruling could still have broad implications for the Voting Rights Act’s protections against racial gerrymandering.</p>



<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">On Jan. 24, Alabama became the second state (after Ohio) to have its new congressional map <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/24/alabama-congressional-map-blocked-federal-court/9205925002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">struck down in court</a>. But while Ohio’s map was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/ohios-overturned-congressional-map-shows-how-lawsuits-might-scramble-redistricting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thrown out</a> by the state Supreme Court for violating the state constitution, Alabama’s was overturned by three federal judges who determined the map short-changed Black voters of representation in Congress. That’s a significant difference because it will require the Supreme Court to weigh in, potentially reshaping federal law in the process. As a result, the ruling could reverberate far beyond Alabama. It could open the door for increased nonwhite representation in other states, too — if it holds up on appeal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a refresher, the U.S. Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/rucho-v-common-cause-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ruled in 2019</a> that partisan gerrymandering was a political question that federal courts should not adjudicate. However, they can still hear cases relating to <em>racial</em> gerrymandering — i.e., whether a map discriminates against voters of a certain race. Alabama poses just such a question. <a href="https://www.al.com/news/2021/11/alabama-senate-rejects-plan-for-new-swing-congressional-district.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Back in November 2021</a>, Alabama’s Republican-controlled legislature passed a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/committee_proposal_1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> that created six majority-white districts and just one majority-Black district. Civil-rights advocates sued, arguing that Black voters in the state were entitled to a second district under the Voting Rights Act, the landmark law that prohibits racial discrimination in voting.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Under <a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/section-2-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Section 2 of the VRA</a>, it’s illegal to deny members of a racial minority equal opportunity to elect representatives of their choice. This has been <a href="http://www.publicmapping.org/what-is-redistricting/redistricting-criteria-the-voting-rights-act" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely interpreted</a> to mean that, when possible,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court decisions and congressional guidelines have, over the years, settled on some &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/crt/case-document/file/1429826/download" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;fundamental criteria&lt;/a&gt; for determining when this requirement kicks in, such as that a minority group must be large and compact enough to constitute a majority of a district and that voting in the area must be polarized by race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a> states must draw congressional districts where nonwhite voters are the dominant voting bloc, so as to reasonably ensure they can elect their preferred candidate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_a/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_b/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed</a> by the <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_c/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plaintiffs</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/alabama/plaintiffs_plan_d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a>, it is readily possible to draw two predominantly Black congressional districts in Alabama. For example, in the plaintiffs’ illustrative plan A, the 2nd District’s voting-age population (VAP) is 50.0 percent Black, and the 7th District’s VAP is 50.3 percent Black.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1726" height="892" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-324932" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.45.13-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">While the VRA explicitly states that racial minorities are not automatically entitled to a number of seats proportional to their share of the population, Black people constitute <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US01&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 25 percent</a> of Alabama’s VAP, much larger than the share of congressional districts they predominate in (14 percent). And many Black votes would have been wasted under the overturned map, with the majority-white 1st, 2nd and 3rd districts all having at least a 24 percent Black VAP.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the judges gave the Alabama Legislature until Feb. 11 to draw a new map that “include[s] two districts in which Black voters either comprise a voting-age majority or something quite close to it.” But by then, it’s possible that the judges’ decision will have been overturned anyway. Alabama has <a href="https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/news/2022/01/28/alabama-asks-supreme-court-stay-order-blocking-congressional-map/9260995002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">appealed the ruling to the Supreme Court</a>, arguing that the map should be reinstated because a new one would disrupt preparations for the state’s upcoming primary and improperly prioritize race in redistricting. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The high court has yet to signal what it will do with the appeal. But the possibilities run a wide gamut: The case could lead to a very favorable outcome for liberals, a very favorable outcome for conservatives or anything in between.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On one end of the spectrum, the Supreme Court could let the lower court’s ruling stand, which would have the immediate impact of adding a new Black-opportunity congressional seat in Alabama. (In practice, this would also add one Democrat and subtract one Republican from Alabama’s congressional delegation.) It would also have ripple effects throughout the Deep South. If this ruling stands, it could inspire courts to create additional Black-opportunity districts in Louisiana and maybe South Carolina as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Currently, only one of Louisiana’s six congressional districts is predominantly Black, despite the state having one of the country’s largest Black population shares: <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US22&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 30 percent</a> of the VAP. With the state’s redistricting process just getting underway this week, Democrats have already proposed <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/louisiana/sb2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maps</a> that would add a majority-Black seat along the Mississippi River north of Baton Rouge. For example, under Senate Bill 4, the 2nd District would have a VAP that’s 51.5 percent Black and the 5th District would have a VAP that’s 50.5 percent Black.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1714" height="802" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png" alt="" class="wp-image-324933" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Screen-Shot-2022-02-03-at-12.46.00-PM.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Because Republicans control the Louisiana Legislature (and these maps would eliminate a Republican member of Congress), they may not be inclined to pass any of these maps. But Gov. John Bel Edwards is a Democrat, and he’s already <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-health-louisiana-legislature-john-bel-edwards-46f6679aafcc1c2c431c78c44c01f503" target="_blank" rel="noopener">come out in favor</a> of a second predominantly Black district. Republicans also lack the numbers in the state House to override a potential veto (although they’d only need to convince two independents or conservative Democrats to side with them to do so). That means Louisiana redistricting will probably be decided by the local courts, which would likely follow the Supreme Court’s lead and greenlight a second Black-opportunity district — if that’s what the high court decides to do in Alabama.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, South Carolina has already enacted a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/redistricting-2022-maps/south-carolina/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new congressional map</a> with only one predominantly Black district out of seven, despite the fact that the Palmetto State is <a href="https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Black%20or%20African%20American&amp;g=0400000US45&amp;tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost one-quarter</a> Black by VAP. However, simple geography may make it harder to convince a court to order a redraw here. While it’s <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::8b0bb8c6-1c6b-4a62-9722-097b7ee1bfd4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible to draw</a> two congressional districts for South Carolina with VAPs that are around 40 percent Black, it’s difficult to draw two <em>majority</em>-Black districts without some <a href="https://davesredistricting.org/maps#viewmap::3fc53f1f-6f41-450c-b035-86a67d0d3d92" target="_blank" rel="noopener">serious contortions</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to <a href="https://www.oyez.org/cases/1985/83-1968" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Supreme Court precedent</a>, plaintiffs in a VRA redistricting case must show that the minority group is “sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.” (Confusingly, a district doesn’t have to be majority-minority in order to <em>comply</em> with the VRA,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, if Black voters constitute a majority of the primary electorate in a heavily Democratic district, that district is likely to elect Black voters’ candidate of choice even if Black voters don’t constitute a majority of the entire electorate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> but it has to be possible to draw one in order for a non-majority-minority district to <em>violate</em> it.) South Carolina may not satisfy this test in a court’s eyes — though, in the event of a favorable outcome at the Supreme Court, liberals may very well try their luck just in case.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With or without South Carolina, though, the Supreme Court letting the Alabama ruling stand would be a significant boon to Black representation in Congress — and from a region that has historically suppressed Black voters to boot. It could potentially lead to two, maybe three, new Black members of Congress from the Deep South. As a result, as many as 18 percent of U.S. representatives from states that constituted the former Confederacy could be Black — the most in U.S. history.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assuming all current Black representatives from the region either win reelection or are replaced with another Black representative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="Black representation in the South could reach a new high" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-wx5hW" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/wx5hW/17/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Again, though, that’s the best-case scenario for minority representation. Given the conservative ideology of the Supreme Court, the justices could instead overturn the lower court’s ruling and restore Alabama’s 6-1 map. It’s even possible that, in so doing, they will actually weaken the VRA’s protections of minority districts. Under Chief Justice John Roberts, the court has already <a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/policy-solutions/effects-shelby-county-v-holder" target="_blank" rel="noopener">neutered Section 5 of the act</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-supreme-court-just-made-it-harder-to-fight-voting-restrictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watered down other protections under Section 2</a>; in an extreme scenario, it could reinterpret Section 2 in a way that makes it even easier for states to draw discriminatory maps.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is still a lot of uncertainty about what the court will do, and as we said earlier, the decision could fall anywhere in between the two extremes we’ve laid out in this article. We’ll just have to wait and see; a decision could come down any day now.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p data-paragraph="main">Virginia’s new governor, Glenn Youngkin, kicked off his term with a political magic trick. In the first of <a href="https://www.governor.virginia.gov/media/governorvirginiagov/governor-of-virginia/pdf/74---eo/74---eo/EO-1---ENDING-THE-USE-OF-INHERENTLY-DIVISIVE-CONCEPTS,-INCLUDING-CRITICAL-RACE-THEORY,-AND-RESTORING-EXCELLEN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine executive orders</a> issued on Jan. 15, the day he took office,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youngkin issued &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.governor.virginia.gov/executive-actions/#directives&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;two executive directives&lt;/a&gt; that day too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a> he banned the teaching of “inherently divisive concepts, including critical race theory” in K-12 public schools. It was a smart way to show his base he’s already jumping on <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-03/gop-seizes-on-hot-button-school-issues-as-2022-election-weapons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issues they care about</a>. Education policy, particularly the <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/so-much-buzz-but-what-is-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alleged role critical race theory</a> plays in public school curricula, was a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/25/youngkin-is-using-critical-race-theory-bogeyman-rile-up-trumpian-base/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">centerpiece of Youngkin’s campaign</a>. But the impact of this executive order is less straightforward than it seems, because critical race theory <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2021/nov/16/rick-scott/critical-race-theory-isnt-virginias-curriculum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t actually taught</a> in Virginia public schools. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This kind of tactic is increasingly familiar in politics today. Republican politicians, in particular, build entire campaigns around false or misleading information, then implement policies that respond to those falsehoods, cementing them further in our political landscape.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The debate <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over critical race theory</a> — a complex academic framework for understanding racism that would never actually be taught to second-graders but that at least <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/fixgov/2021/07/02/why-are-states-banning-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nine state legislatures</a> have tried to ban anyway — is just one such example. There’s an entire gamut of culture wars where this dynamic has taken hold. Abortion, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/15/opinion/abortion-evangelicals-conservatives.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the most powerful</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/made-by-history/wp/2018/01/22/how-abortion-became-the-single-most-important-litmus-test-in-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long-lasting</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/4/10/18295513/abortion-2020-roe-joe-biden-democrats-republicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">social issues in modern politics</a>, is another example where arguments are increasingly framed in ways that tend to benefit Republicans. And because of that, Democrats frequently appear to be ceding ground, even though voters typically trust them more than Republicans on these issues and <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/public-opinion-on-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public opinion is often on the Democrats’ side</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The rebuttal to these issues seems like it should be simple. Why not just tell voters that critical race theory isn’t being taught and move on? Or say that abortions are safe and increasingly rare but will always be necessary for some women? But so far, Democrats haven’t really figured out a way to convince voters that some GOP messages aren’t based in reality. Experts told us that’s because Republicans’ often misleading framing is effective not because Americans believe it wholeheartedly or because they know all that much about the issue. Rather, the reason why abortion rights and critical race theory sticks in people’s minds is that these issues touch on broader anxieties. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Calling critical race theory an ‘existential threat’ activates racial animus and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fears around white victimhood</a>, which are strongly tied to support for conservative candidates and policies,” said <a href="https://www.wellesley.edu/politicalscience/faculty/arora" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maneesh Arora</a>, a political scientist at Wellesley College. Once those fears have been stirred up, Arora and other experts told us that it can be very difficult for other politicians to dismiss them. In fact, politicians’ sparring over the facts — or Democrats’ oversimplifying voters’ concerns as “<a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/obama-to-virginia-dont-elect-a-governor-who-will-indulge-in-our-worst-instincts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fake outrage</a>” — might make those underlying fears seem more justified. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So that leaves Democrats going into a midterm election year with a serious conundrum: How do they fight a messaging war when the other side is playing fast and loose with the truth?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For years, the debate over abortion has revolved around misleading or downright inaccurate claims — like when former President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18221707/trump-rally-el-paso-northam-abortion-virginia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">accused Democrats of promoting infanticide</a> (<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/apr/29/donald-trump/donald-trump-repeats-falsely-doctors-mothers-decid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they were not</a>), or when 20 Republican senators <a href="https://www.cruz.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/sen-cruz-senate-colleagues-send-letter-to-fda-commissioner-urging-abortion-pill-be-classified-as-hazard-to-public-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener">petitioned the Food and Drug Administration</a> to classify the abortion-inducing drug mifepristone as a public health hazard (<a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90547138/despite-republican-attacks-abortion-pill-mifeprex-is-not-dangerous" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it is not</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Myriad state-level abortion policies are also based on faulty or spurious science — including <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/mandatory-counseling-abortion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">counseling that requires abortion providers</a> to tell patients, inaccurately, that abortion is linked to breast cancer or infertility; legislation that <a href="https://journalofethics.ama-assn.org/article/fetal-pain-legislation/2014-10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">limits abortion after a certain point</a> because of disputed research on fetal pain; and <a href="https://www.guttmacher.org/evidence-you-can-use/targeted-regulation-abortion-providers-trap-laws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a web of restrictions on abortion providers</a> that similar health care providers don’t face, often justified by the incorrect assertion that abortion is dangerous.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are generally not following the ins and outs of abortion politics — if anything, they may be actively avoiding it — but that also works to Republicans’ advantage. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-really-think-about-abortion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans’ views about abortion are fuzzy and malleable</a>, in large part because they just don’t know very much about it. A <a href="https://www.kff.org/womens-health-policy/poll-finding/abortion-knowledge-and-attitudes-kff-polling-and-policy-insights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kaiser Family Foundation</a> poll conducted in December 2019 found that Americans tend to overestimate how many abortions happen late in pregnancy, and underestimate how many abortions happen early. And while a majority are aware that abortion performed in a medical setting is safe, they were off about just how safe it is: Only about a quarter know, for instance, that it is <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22270271/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">safer than giving birth</a> or getting your appendix removed, which a number of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK507236/pdf/Bookshelf_NBK507236.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies support</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even without much information to go on, the idea that women and doctors, abetted by Democrats, are advocating to “execute” babies —&nbsp;which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/us/politics/trump-abortion-fact-check.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump has claimed</a> on <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election/trump-rally-speech-after-birth-execution-abortion-tulsa-a9577591.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple occasions</a> — might seem too outlandish to believe. But <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tresa Undem</a>, a researcher who studies public opinion on abortion, said that this kind of framing is successful not because Americans wholeheartedly believe it but because they don’t wholeheartedly <em>disbelieve</em> it.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“​​Abortion later in pregnancy — it’s so rare that the vast majority of people don’t have personal experience with it and it’s never ever talked about,” Undem said. “So if Trump and Republicans come along and say there are doctors ripping babies from women’s wombs at the moment before birth, people will be like, ‘What?’ and there’s nothing in their minds to push back. They won’t necessarily believe it, but they’re not going to <em>not</em> believe it. That’s where I think Republicans are really successful.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Like critical race theory, abortion also taps into much deeper anxieties — in this case, about gender roles. Polls by Undem and others have found that attitudes toward abortion <a href="https://twitter.com/teemoneyusa/status/1218299448821940224?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener">track closely with broader attitudes</a> about women’s place in society. Perhaps unsurprisingly, people who hold traditional views, which often emphasize women’s roles as mothers, are more likely to oppose abortion.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But as misleading ideas about abortion become embedded in policy, those misleading concepts come to feel increasingly real. “There are hundreds and hundreds of policies that have been passed around the idea that women will ultimately come to regret their decision [to have an abortion] and therefore the state has to intervene to protect them and give them the knowledge they need,” said <a href="https://kupa.ku.edu/alesha-doan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alesha Doan</a>, a political scientist at the University of Kansas. There’s no evidence that this is actually true — in fact, <a href="https://www.ucsf.edu/news/2020/01/416421/five-years-after-abortion-nearly-all-women-say-it-was-right-decision-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the opposite seems to be the case</a> — but the policies give it an air of certainty. “People assume that politicians are passing laws for a reason, so the laws legitimize the idea that abortion regret is widespread and give it traction,” Doan said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Undem told us that abortion has been a successful culture-war issue on the right because most people don’t need to know much, if anything, about the reality of abortion in America to have an opinion on it. The debate is about values: who gets to make the decision to have an abortion, who should be involved, how much to weigh the life of a fetus.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In that sense, then, critical race theory is similar. Voters ordinarily <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/15/new-poll-shows-gop-nullifying-democrats-edge-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trust Democrats</a> over Republicans on education, but invoking critical race theory is different from sparring over class size or test scores. Fundamentally, it’s also about values — specifically, how children should be taught about racism. And it’s taking hold because of conservative white parents’ fears of a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/first-it-was-sex-ed-now-its-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more progressive school curriculum</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling suggests that this often misleading messaging is taking hold, too, as a notable share of Americans — namely Republicans — falsely believe that critical race theory is nothing more than a sinister plot to teach white children that they’re inherently evil. According to a July <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-07/Reuters%20Ipsos%20Critical%20Race%20Theory%20Topline%20071521%20_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reuters/Ipsos</a> poll, for example, 20 percent of Americans (including 16 percent of Democrats and 31 percent of Republicans) said they believed that critical race theory “says that discriminating against white people is the only way to achieve equality.” Moreover, 22 percent said they believed that critical race theory “says that white people are inherently evil or bad.” In fact, critical race theory <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says neither of these things</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even though a November Economist/YouGov poll found that <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2021/11/16/critical-race-theory-who-believes-being-taught" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a majority of Americans</a> didn’t think or weren’t sure that critical race theory was being taught in their community’s schools, there’s still a misunderstanding on how bans on critical race theory <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/05/28/1000537206/teachers-laws-banning-critical-race-theory-are-leading-to-self-censorship" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could affect the teaching of related subjects</a> that parents <em>do</em> want their kids to learn. A <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/2021-09/Topline_USA%20Today%20back%20to%20school%20and%20COVID_090221.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Today/Ipsos</a> poll from late August and early September highlighted that schism: While 63 percent of parents with school-aged children said they supported their schools’ teaching about the lingering effects of slavery and racism, just 49 percent said they supported the teaching of critical race theory. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to historian <a href="https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/keisha-n-blain/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.newamerica.org/our-people/keisha-n-blain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Keisha Blain</a>, a 2022 National Fellow at New America and professor at the University of Pittsburgh, it’s hard to separate the current opposition to critical race theory in schools from a white backlash to a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/white-backlash-is-a-type-of-racial-reckoning-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perceived loss of power and status</a>. “We have seen this kind of response before in the aftermath of the civil rights movement. White conservatives began to propagate the false argument that Black Americans were somehow receiving ‘special treatment’ and thereby threatening the rights and opportunities for white people,” she said. “In the end, backlash politics thrive on misinformation, and they always rise to the surface as a way to counter any kind of political progress for marginalized groups.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the framing of abortion and critical race theory fights offers a kind of roadmap that other Republican politicians might use to run successful campaigns over the coming years. But, as several experts noted, GOP voters are not inherently gullible, nor are they more prone than Democrats to believing misinformation. “Both sides are vulnerable,” said <a href="https://sites.dartmouth.edu/nyhan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brendan Nyhan</a>, a Dartmouth College political scientist who studies misinformation. “One of the key factors right now is that there’s a more developed apparatus for promoting false claims on the right. There’s a right-wing media ecosystem that doesn’t have a direct parallel on the left in its scope or influence.”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So what can Democrats do in response? One potentially disastrous option for them is to keep engaging with these issues on Republicans’ terms. While this might be easier said than done, as partisanship and strong party loyalties <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/conservative-and-liberal-brains-might-have-some-real-differences/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">help misleading information spread and thrive</a>, Democrats can still realize when they’re in a fight they can’t win.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That leaves them with two leading possibilities: They could unravel some of the misinformation out there, reframing conversations in ways that are both truthful and potentially beneficial to them electorally. With abortion, that could mean talking about it as an issue that’s fundamentally about women’s power and autonomy. And on critical race theory, as Blain told us, that might look like them providing evidence on what these bans in schools really mean for public school curricula. For example, over the next several years, executive orders like the one Youngkin issued are likely to lead to teachers getting <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/education/fearful-of-new-laws-many-teachers-deterred-from-covering-race-related-topics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reprimanded for doing their jobs</a>. (Youngkin, for his part, already <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/glenn-youngkin-sets-tip-line-parents-report-crt-despite-not-being-curriculum-1672741" target="_blank" rel="noopener">implemented a tip line</a> for parents to report “inherently divisive practices,” like teaching critical race theory, in schools.) So if Democrats can condemn those offenses while also reframing public discourse on those issues, public opinion — and the terms of how these debates are framed — may later be on their side. “Democrats need to push back against proposed bills that use the label of ‘critical race theory’ as a cover to simply remove the writings of Black and brown authors from the classroom,” Blain said.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Alternatively, Democrats could coalesce around a completely different message that energizes their <em>own</em> base “rather than getting stuck talking about critical race theory — which is something that animates the right, and just isn&#8217;t really an issue on the left,” Arora said. Because of increasing partisan polarization, he said, it’s unlikely Republican voters’ opinion on this issue will change unless elites in their own circles say otherwise, so it may be prudent for Democrats to focus on where they can unify their own base instead.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Regardless of the choice Democrats make, though, experts said that telling voters their fears and concerns about these issues <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/obama-to-virginia-dont-elect-a-governor-who-will-indulge-in-our-worst-instincts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">aren’t real</a> is the worst of both worlds. After all, insisting that the focus on critical race theory is just fake news will only alienate the people who believe it’s not — and it won’t do much to convince Democratic voters that they should care about the underlying issues either.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">On July 29, 1994, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1032/vote_103_2_00242.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the U.S. Senate voted</a> 87 to 9 to confirm Stephen Breyer to the Supreme Court. Nominated by Democratic President Bill Clinton, Breyer <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/103-1994/s242" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received 100 percent support</a> from the Democratic senators present, but he also secured 79 percent of the votes cast by Republicans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That kind of overwhelming and bipartisan support for a president’s Supreme Court nominee wasn’t unusual at the time, but it ended up marking the end of an era. Breyer received more than 90 percent of the votes cast on his confirmation, in line with about three-fourths of Supreme Court nominees in U.S. history up to that point.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including voice votes, where no vote tally is recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> But as the chart below shows, only one of the seven justices confirmed since Breyer — Chief Justice John Roberts — has received more than 69 percent of the Senate’s votes, and Roberts is also the only one to have earned the backing of a majority of the other party’s senators.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="Filling Supreme Court seats has become more contentious" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-UYCW2" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/UYCW2/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/nominations/judge-parker-nomination-rejected.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not to say that</a> Supreme Court <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2016/03/legal-history-highlight-the-failed-election-year-nomination-of-abe-fortas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nomination processes</a> always <a href="https://www.oyez.org/justices/clarence_thomas" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went smoothly</a> prior to Breyer, and the Senate has rejected nominees or only narrowly confirmed them many times in the past, but as Princeton University political scientist <a href="https://scholar.princeton.edu/jkastellec/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Kastellec</a>’s data of Senate votes on high-court nominees since the nation’s founding shows, most nominees were overwhelmingly confirmed by the Senate. In fact, about half of all Supreme Court nomination votes have been <a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/voting.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">voice votes</a>, with no tally of individual votes — typically an indication of little or no opposition, as a senator would likely call for a recorded vote otherwise.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those days are long gone, though. Since Breyer’s confirmation, four of the seven confirmed justices received less than 60 percent overall support in the Senate, and those four each earned support from less than 10 percent of the opposing party’s senators. This includes all three of former President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court picks, who progressively received less bipartisan backing: <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1151/vote_115_1_00111.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neil Gorsuch got just two</a> Democratic yeas in April 2017, <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1152/vote_115_2_00223.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brett Kavanaugh one</a> in October 2018 and <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_votes/vote1162/vote_116_2_00224.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amy Coney Barrett zero</a> in October 2020. In fact, Barrett’s lack of cross-party support marked the first time since 1869 that a Supreme Court nominee failed to garner a single vote from the other party. And with all three of Trump’s picks, they were confirmed only because of a Republican majority in the Senate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now it's Democrats’ turn to push their nominee, but they have even less margin for error than Republicans did during Trump’s tenure. Whereas Republicans always had at least one vote they could afford to lose, Democrats in a 50-50 Senate can’t spare a single vote.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="15" href="#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This includes two independent senators, Angus King of Maine and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, who caucus with the Democrats. Democrats have the majority thanks to Vice President Kamala Harris&rsquo;s tie-breaking vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a> It’s why <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/03/30/598115811/the-fall-of-harriet-miers-a-cautionary-tale-for-dr-ronny-jackson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any hiccup in the nomination process</a>, including <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/10/upshot/democrats-agenda-hinges-health.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some sort of health issue</a> for a Democratic senator, could create real problems for Democrats.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As my colleague Nathaniel Rakich <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-joe-manchin-and-kyrsten-sinema-will-probably-vote-for-bidens-supreme-court-pick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently wrote for this site</a>, there’s reason to think that all 50 Democrats will back Biden’s eventual pick, despite their recent trouble passing legislative priorities, such as Biden’s social spending plan and voting rights bill. And there’s some indication that a Republican senator or two might consider voting for the nominee, too. But at the same time, more moderate members of the GOP caucus, such as Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, could give way to intraparty pressure to oppose Biden’s pick. Collins, for her part, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/collins-bidens-handling-scotus-vacancy-clumsy-best/story?id=82553277" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently criticized</a> how Biden had gone about publicly promising to nominate a Black woman for Breyer’s spot on the court, while Murkowski faces a tough reelection battle and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/changing-how-primaries-work-probably-wont-make-politics-less-divisive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may want to avoid further irritating</a> her already-frustrated party base.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this comes within the confines of the increased polarization in our politics, too, which has simply upped the ante on Supreme Court appointments. In fact, conflicts of the judicial branch are among the best illustrations of how the Senate has become more partisan, more majoritarian and less consensus-driven. First, in 2013, facing Republican opposition to judges nominated by Barack Obama, then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid backed the “<a href="https://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/harry-reid-nuclear-option-100199" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nuclear option</a>” to require simple majorities to confirm lower-court nominees. Then, in 2016, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the new majority leader, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/merrick-garland-senate-republicans-timeline/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prevented a vote</a> on Obama’s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland, in the hopes of keeping a seat open for a potential GOP president to fill — which is exactly how it panned out. To confirm conservative justices like Gorsuch (and those after him), McConnell <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/04/06/522847700/senate-pulls-nuclear-trigger-to-ease-gorsuch-confirmation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expanded the use of simple majorities</a> to confirm Supreme Court justices as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now we face the <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/26/supreme-court-confirmation-congress-00002420" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential scenario</a> where the Senate confirms a Supreme Court nominee on a 50-50 vote with the vice president breaking the tie. That may or may not happen with Biden’s eventual choice, but it hangs out there as a distinct possibility because of the polarized times we live in. And that reality reflects the new normal of close, mostly party-line votes for nominees to the Supreme Court.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It’s Supreme Court nomination season again. Last week, Justice Stephen Breyer announced that he will retire from the court at the end of the term, and President Biden has said he will name his nominee by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/01/27/us/stephen-breyer-supreme-court-retire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">end of February</a>. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/30/1076798457/biden-may-fulfill-a-campaign-promise-to-black-voters-with-his-supreme-court-nomi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In keeping with a campaign promise</a>, Biden is widely expected to nominate a Black woman, too, with <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/28/1076579467/biden-supreme-court-nominee-breyer-replacement" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possible replacements including</a> Ketanji Brown Jackson, a judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals; Leondra Kruger, a justice on the California Supreme Court; and J. Michelle Childs, a district court judge in South Carolina — among others.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Appointing the first Black woman to the Supreme Court would make history, but this hasn’t <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/27/biden-scotus-pick-conservative-criticism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stopped some from criticizing Biden</a> for limiting his search to candidates of one specific gender and race. Underlying those complaints is the assumption that a Black woman would be less qualified than other potential nominees, but our analysis shows just how flawed that assumption is. We looked at data from the Federal Judicial Center and found that while Biden is indeed diversifying the courts — in just one year, he’s appointed 24 percent of the Black women on the federal bench — it’s simply not true that he’s weighing diversity more highly than the qualifications usually used to evaluate judges. In fact, his lower-court appointees are arguably <em>more</em> highly qualified on those metrics than the judges selected by previous presidents, and that’s particularly true of the Black women he’s named.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This past December, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-biden-is-reshaping-the-courts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when we assessed how well Biden was delivering</a> on his promise of expanding the diversity of the courts, we found that the vast majority of his appointees were people of color. Almost two months later, an additional 14 judges have been confirmed — bringing the number of Biden appointees to 42 — and Biden’s judicial appointees are still far more diverse than previous presidents’ appointees.</p>

So far, more than one-quarter (26 percent) of Biden’s appointees are Black women, including five Black women who were nominated to serve on appeals courts. </p>

Perhaps even more strikingly, five of the nine Black women who are currently serving as appeals court judges were appointed by Biden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden is diversifying the courts in other ways, too. According to our analysis, many of Biden’s appointees have professional backgrounds that aren’t typical for federal judges. In the past, a common pathway for judges was to work as a prosecutor: About 40 percent of Obama’s appointees and Trump’s appointees had worked as a prosecutor at one point or another. Biden’s appointees are different, though. They’re much less likely to have worked in prosecution — and more more likely to have worked in advocacy and public defense.</p>

In fact, when it comes to education, Biden’s appointees are even more highly credentialed than other presidents’ appointees. Nearly 30 percent of Biden appointees attended Ivy League universities for their undergraduate degree, and nearly 60 percent attended a top-ranked law school.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Rather than being less qualified than their white counterparts, Black women are actually <em>more</em> highly credentialed than the average Biden judge. We found that Black women were particularly likely to have attended an elite institution. More than one-third (36 percent) of Black women that Biden named to the courts attended an Ivy League university, and 82 percent attended a top-ranked law school.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For top-ranked law schools, we used the top-14 schools that appear on the &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/law-rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;2022 list&lt;/a&gt; compiled by U.S. News and World Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a> Black women also stood out among Biden’s appointees on another metric commonly used to assess judges: <a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/committees/federal_judiciary/ratings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ratings produced by the American Bar Association</a> for federal judicial nominees. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Overall, we found that Black judges actually had lower ABA ratings than white judges, but that shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that they’re less qualified. <a href="https://ash.harvard.edu/files/how_judicial_qualification_ratings_may_disadvantage_minority_and_female_candidates.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Political scientists have found</a> that minority judicial nominees tend to receive lower ratings than white nominees, even controlling for education and experience. The vast majority (82 percent) of the Black women nominated by Biden received the ABA’s highest rating when they were first nominated to the federal bench, however. That’s all the more impressive when you factor in that it’s harder for Black judicial nominees to receive a high ABA rating.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This shows that Biden isn’t sacrificing traditional qualifications in pursuit of diversity. If anything, he seems to be prioritizing Black women with highly burnished legal resumes for judicial appointments — perhaps doing so in anticipation of exactly the kinds of complaints about “diversity picks” that we’re already seeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In fact, the potential nominees to replace Breyer are very similar to the federal judges Biden has appointed so far. Like Biden’s other judges, the potential nominees tend to have worked in public defense or public service; Jackson is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/30/us/politics/supreme-court-ketanji-brown-jackson.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former public defender</a>, and Kruger <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/justice-leondra-r-kruger.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worked in the Obama administration</a>. The potential nominees also have plenty of traditional qualifications, like Ivy League degrees, experience as judges, high ratings from national and state bar associations and Supreme Court clerkships. In fact, Jackson and Kruger are very similar to the Supreme Court’s current justices, most of whom attended Ivy League universities or law schools, clerked for another Supreme Court justice and served as federal judges. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, there’s a case to be made that having so little educational and professional diversity on the Supreme Court is actually a bad thing. Justice Clarence Thomas, who attended Yale for law school <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-court-thomas/clarence-thomas-reconciles-with-yale-after-bitter-years-idUSBRE84T1KE20120530" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but wrote that he stores the degree</a> in his basement with a 15-cent sticker on the frame, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2019/07/clarence-thomas-trump/593596/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has gone out of his way</a> to hire clerks who didn’t attend Ivy League schools, <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2012/09/when-it-comes-to-hiring-scotus-clerks-clarence-thomas-still-doesnt-give-a-damn-about-the-u-s-news-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">arguing</a> that the legal profession’s bias toward elite schools doesn’t produce better lawyers. South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn has argued that potential Breyer-replacement nominee Childs, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/26/us/politics/j-michelle-childs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a southerner with a blue-collar background</a>, would add more value to the court than yet another Ivy-educated lawyer. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even so, it’s indisputable that all of Biden’s appointees are highly qualified to serve on the federal courts, as are his potential Supreme Court nominees. Meanwhile, they offer other kinds of diversity that are rare on the current court — and in the federal judiciary as a whole.</p>]]></content:encoded>
