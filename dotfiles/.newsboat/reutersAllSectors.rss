The story, with reporting from the United States, Europe and Asia, also revealed how far behind Novavax is in fulfilling its promises to governments and to COVAX, the global vaccine distribution program that plays a key role in supplying the vaccines to low-income countries. Officials in the Philippines said that they are now seeking to trim their Novavax contract, as a longer-than-expected wait for the company’s vaccine led the country to stockpile supply from other drugmakers. Several industry analysts said they are reviewing their 2022 vaccine sales forecasts of around $5 billion for Novavax in light of the news.</p>

The companies, which provide road and sea-cargo handling machinery and services to industries, factories, ports and terminals, announced the deal in October last year but subsequently faced opposition from the European Commission. Konecranes and Cargotec last month offered to sell assets to address the EU competition enforcer’s concerns that the merger may curb competition and push up prices.</p>

Aeromexico, which filed for bankruptcy in June 2020 as demand cratered in the first months of the pandemic, won final court approval for a restructuring plan that aims to reduce its debt from $2 billion to more than $1 billion. But even after slashing its debt load and operating costs under Chapter 11 protection, Aeromexico may struggle to claw back ground lost to low-cost carriers.</p>

The officials, from the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, strongly criticized the companies and said their inaction on fake news was forcing the Indian government to order content takedowns, which in turn drew international criticism that authorities were suppressing free expression.&nbsp;</p>

Prices of granular potash fertilizer are near 10-year highs in the United States and Brazil, helped by Western economic sanctions against Belarus. Russia, home of Uralkali and EuroChem potash mines, faces possible economic sanctions if it invades Ukraine. Uralkali and Belarus Potash Company (BPC) together account for more than one-third of global potash sales, according to BMO Capital Markets.</p>
