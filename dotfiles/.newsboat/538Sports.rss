<p data-paragraph="main">Americans <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are pessimistic</a> about one of the weirdest economies in recent memory, and their negativity is largely due to inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced today that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices increased 7.5 percent year-over-year in January 2022</a>, the highest figure since 1982, and as such, more expensive milk, furniture and cars — and the fear that their prices <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will continue to skyrocket</a> — are likely to remain top of mind for Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, of course, has led to a lot of finger-pointing as to who — or what — is to blame for the price increases we’re seeing. Democrats have <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-democrats-supply-chain-prices-midterms-f6de1ceb-21a1-469c-a83f-88f48fc07a4b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed supply chain deficiencies</a> due to COVID-19, as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/10/white-house-inflation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large corporations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/business/biden-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monopolies</a>. Republicans, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/10/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-whats-their-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked</a> President Biden’s legislative agenda, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-are-they-right-2021-11-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming that his signature pieces of legislation</a> — most notably the American Rescue Plan featuring $1,400 stimulus checks paid directly to many Americans — are to blame. And to be sure, whether fair or not, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans</a> do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/business/economy/biden-economy-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame Biden</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what <em>is </em>responsible for inflation in the U.S.? Is it all about the pandemic supply chain, as many Democrats claim, or corporate greed? Or does it have more to do with Biden’s policies, as Republicans have posited?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="inflation-isn-t-just-a-supply-chain-issue-and-the-stimulus-likely-made-it-worse"><strong>Inflation isn’t just a supply-chain issue, and the stimulus likely made it worse</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the Democrats’ most consistent talking points has been that the COVID-19-afflicted supply chain is to blame for our current levels of inflation. Biden has even gone as far as to say that supply chain issues have “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAqwiD_CH-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything to do</a>” with it, while House Democrats work to craft legislation <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/house-democrats-pivot-economy-legislative-win-00003385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted at ameliorating supply chain issues</a>. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/inflation-economy-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many economists</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/11/22829221/inflation-rate-cpi-supply-chain-biden-transitory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> say that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/15/omicron-supply-chain-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the foundering supply chain</a> has played a heavy hand in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/10/24/22743104/supply-chain-inflation-shortages-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving up prices</a>, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The thinking goes as follows: Americans stopped using their gym, nail salons and other services as their spending patterns rapidly changed in 2020, and the global supply chain — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/business/shortages-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already had issues</a> —&nbsp; was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/business/inflation-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not equipped to deal with the surge</a> in demand for consumer durables (e.g., home workout equipment, office furniture) after the initial global economic shutdown. Combine that rapid demand increase with a shortage in supply, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inflation-definition.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-supply-chain&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_top_links_recirc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you get higher prices</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the same time, this Democratic talking point has its limits, as it’s become clear to many economists that American inflation isn’t <em>just</em> a supply chain issue: Our economic response — namely, the trillions of dollars of COVID-19 stimulus paid out over the last 24 months — appears to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-13/u-s-inflation-is-starting-to-look-like-a-stimulus-led-outlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meaningful differentiator</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A good way to tease this out is to look at Europe, which has faced similar supply chain issues and an even worse oil shock, as it is more dependent on foreign oil <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&amp;t=6#:~:text=How%20much%20oil%20consumed%20by,day%20(b%2Fd)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the U.S.</a> And yet, European countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/business/ecb-europe-interest-rates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have experienced lower inflation</a>, perhaps due in part to <a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2021/number/4/article/fiscal-stimulus-lessons-from-the-us-to-the-eu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their smaller government response</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Global supply chain problems affect every country in the world, but the United States has had more inflation than other countries,” said <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/people/jason-furman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Furman</a>, a professor of economics at Harvard University and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama. “If you look compared to Europe, in the United States goods consumption is higher, and services consumption is higher than what it is [in Europe].”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason for that higher consumption is government spending. In 2020, a divided Congress under former President Donald Trump passed two separate pieces of legislation — first the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion CARES Act</a> in March, which <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/28/how-many-people-will-get-1200-in-every-state/111604090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doled out</a> $1,200 checks to most single adults and even more to families, then a $900 billion package <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/21/948862052/house-passes-900-billion-coronavirus-relief-bill-ending-months-long-stalemate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in December</a> that, among other aid, issued $600 targeted checks. But then in March 2021, Democrats passed another round of government stimulus in a $1.9 trillion relief package — including $1,400 direct payments to individual Americans — which some experts warned at the time <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/summers-warns-u-s-risks-rising-inflation-amid-massive-stimulus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might cause inflation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it does appear that this most recent round of government spending is at least partially responsible for our current levels of inflation. An October 2021 paper found, for example, that the American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2021/october/is-american-rescue-plan-taking-us-back-to-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely made inflation slightly worse</a>, causing significant (but small and fleeting) upward pressure on prices, and many experts have stood by their 2021 assertions that the extra stimulus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/business/economy/inflation-biden-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would lead to inflation</a>. Of course, Biden’s additional stimulus was arguably <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/2021-was-a-year-of-bold-economic-policy-that-must-be-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary for Americans to participate in the economy</a> at the time, and polling <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/19/most-americans-say-another-round-of-covid-19-economic-relief-will-be-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found widespread support</a> among Americans for more relief. But it has also led <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-target-biden-democrats-over-inflation-what-would-they-do-n1284839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans to claim</a> that Biden’s policies are responsible for the historic price increases we’re seeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furman stressed to me that inflation likely would have been high even without a COVID-19 relief bill, however, because of a reopening economy and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/what-are-base-effects-and-how-do-they-distort-inflation-yahoo-u-113754047.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base effect distortions</a>. Moreover, rising gas prices — one of the most tangible ways in which Americans process inflation — likely have nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan and much more to do with the dynamics of global oil. There is at least some evidence, though, that government spending has caused inflation, beyond the explanation that it’s merely been a supply chain issue.</p>



<h2 id="but-not-all-government-spending-leads-to-inflation"><strong>But not all government spending leads to inflation</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Critically, however, despite what many Republicans claim, not all government spending has the same effect on inflation. In fact, historically government spending hasn’t usually led to inflation. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014292114001494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 paper</a> in the European Economic Review found, for example, that the effect of government spending on inflation post-World War II was “<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/may/how-does-government-spending-affect-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not statistically different from zero</a>.” But <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/dupor/sel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Dupor</a>, a co-author of that study and vice president of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told me that the size of the intervention matters — and that could help explain why government spending today has spurred inflation but hadn’t in recent memory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The big difference, I think, from now relative to that is just the enormity of the government spending,” Dupor said. “That could explain why it wasn&#8217;t finding big effects, while there could be big effects now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, not all government spending the Biden administration has greenlit has likely contributed to inflation. For example, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law in November is unlikely to have contributed to inflation for a number of reasons. First of all, very <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/biden-infrastructure-bill-spending-economy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little of it has been paid for</a> at this point. Second, it’s targeted at ramping up the productive capacity of the economy — i.e., investing in new technologies and creating jobs — which means it might <a href="https://www.epi.org/open-letter-from-nobel-laureates-in-support-of-economic-recovery-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even tamp down inflation</a>. That’s different from the American Rescue Plan, whose $1,400 stimulus checks don’t build up the economy in the same way, according to the economists I spoke with.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans, however, aren’t necessarily making this kind of distinction when it comes to government spending. According to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/26/biden-poll-social-spending-inflation-00001785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January Politico-Harvard survey</a>, 43 percent of Americans think that the bipartisan infrastructure bill will increase inflation, while just 10 percent think it will decrease inflation (although 35 percent did say they think inflation will remain unchanged).&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/thomas-philippon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Philippon</a>, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said that his biggest concern with the recent inflation brought about by the stimulus is that it muddies the waters of government spending in the eyes of voters. That, in turn, Philippon said, expends political capital that can’t be used to tackle other key issues, like infrastructure spending or child poverty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People then lump together all kinds of government spending, the good and the bad,” Philippon said.</p>



<h2 id="big-corporations-aren-t-the-biggest-cause-but">Big corporations aren&#8217;t the biggest cause, but …</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, some Democrats have singled out big companies and monopolies for their perceived role in driving up prices. Figures across the party’s ideological gamut -— from Sens. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/25/inflation-cause-democrats-amplify-nonsense-corporate-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/12/1072295047/inflation-is-still-surging-and-some-democrats-see-one-culprit-greedy-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a> to Biden — have posited that big businesses, by jacking up their prices in the middle of a pandemic, are to blame for inflation, and that a lack of competition has allowed corporate behemoths to raise their prices unabated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, this explanation appears less plausible than other messaging on inflation. Profit-seeking companies didn’t suddenly become more profit-seeking during the pandemic, nor were they more generous before it. Additionally, corporate concentration has <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164974/corporate-concentration-inflation-price-gouging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown steadily since the 1990s</a> — an era of historically low inflation. <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/inflation-market-power-and-price-controls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A January survey of economists</a> at the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found most experts in agreement on both questions: Inflation wasn’t explained by big firms deciding to get richer, and antitrust interventions — such as those tossed about by the Biden administration — weren’t likely to curb inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is an element of the prices we’re seeing today — and how Americans are responding to them — that could be explained by big business run amok. Philippon, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose book</a> “The Great Reversal” focuses on how a lack of competition and corporate concentration have defined the modern American economy, told me that one reason why inflation is such a big deal in the U.S. is that prices were already so high to begin with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That&#8217;s not a statement about rapid inflation, it&#8217;s a statement about slowly rising profit margins that slowly choke off the middle class,” Philippon said. “One reason it&#8217;s particularly painful in the U.S. is that prices were already high, people&#8217;s purchasing power, the real value of their wages was already being eroded by market power before. Then when you add to that a burst of inflation, it&#8217;s even more painful.”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That may explain why recent polling has found that Americans <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-find-link-between-inflation-and-corporate-greed-convincing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sympathetic</a> to arguments that attribute inflation to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/19/inflation-companies-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate greed</a>, and why Biden is singing a fairly populist tune on inflation. But as with all aspects of messaging on the issue, whether Democrats or Republicans are more right on the facts of inflation has very little to do with its potential electoral impact. Prices have to stabilize for Americans to feel good about the economy — and for Democrats to feel good about their chances in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t think there’s any message that would make people feel good about 7 percent inflation,” Furman said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">It was the summer of 1979, and President Jimmy Carter was up against it. Americans were paying far more for gas and groceries than they were the year before, and Carter was confronted with a choice: He could tell Americans that this was a problem the government could fix, or he could tell them to tighten their belts and persevere. He chose <a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106508243" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the latter</a>. But prices continued to rise, and in 1980, Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan <a href="https://www.270towin.com/1980_Election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a landslide</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Things aren’t as bad as they were in 1979, but for many, <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/inflation-crisis-joe-bidens-vs-jimmy-carters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the comparison</a> is still apt. According to the latest consumer price index<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all urban consumers, and including food and energy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a> numbers, prices in November were up 6.9 percent compared with a year ago, the highest increase since 1982. And that comes alongside <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/coming-up-december-umich-consumer-sentiment-11639147437" target="_blank" rel="noopener">near-record-low consumer sentiment</a> and a <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">net approval rating</a> for President Biden of -7.6 percentage points.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of 5 p.m. Eastern on Dec. 13.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> Biden has said <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2021/11/16/joe-bidens-empty-inflation-toolbox-522552" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reversing inflation is a priority</a> for his administration, and he has <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-is-biden-tapping-the-strategic-oil-reserve-and-will-that-lower-gas-prices-11637680300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released strategic reserves of oil</a> and announced plans to “<a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/11/23/remarks-by-president-biden-on-the-economy-and-lowering-prices-for-the-american-people/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relieve bottlenecks</a>” to address soaring prices, but a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/12/10/white-house-inflation-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difficult and uncertain road</a> lies ahead.</p>

You can’t miss rising prices, and research has found that Americans care deeply about inflation. But the politics of handling it is messy, and should prices continue to rise, Biden has a difficult task. He faces a country that views inflation through a highly partisan lens — and that will judge his performance on the issue accordingly. If he ignores inflation, it could spiral as it did with Carter. But at the same time, should Biden react too forcefully, the <a href="https://prospect.org/economy/biden-dont-repeat-jimmy-carters-catastrophic-mistake-on-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cure could be worse than the disease</a>. </p>



<h2><strong>Inflation’s unique place in the American psyche is bad for presidents </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Inflation occupies a unique place in American life. That’s in part because price increases can feel far more palpable than something like the government deficit; they’re also front and center for the average consumer. Add to that the power of political memory: The Great Inflation brought along <a href="https://theweek.com/inflation/1006994/democrats-are-learning-a-vintage-lesson-about-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four recessions from 1969 to 1982</a> and has had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/30/books/review/Scheiber-t.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an indelible effect on our politics</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Trying to pinpoint what’s causing today’s inflation, though, is challenging. The pandemic <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/11/business/economy/coronavirus-us-economy-spending.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transformed the economy</a>, and many experts pointed to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/business/dealbook/inflation-questions-experts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exceptional nature of this economic recovery</a> as the primary driver of inflation. <a href="https://www.chicagobooth.edu/faculty/directory/g/austan-d-goolsbee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Austan Goolsbee</a>, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, stressed to me that the abnormality of the pandemic-induced downturn is key to understanding the price increases we’re seeing now.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This was a serious downturn, but it really wasn’t a recession. It didn’t look anything like a recession,” said Goolsbee. “Normally, the thing that drives a recession is long-lived items that get put off, like consumer durables and housing. And those things rose in the downturn.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But though Goolsbee is on the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22346376/inflation-rate-explained-federal-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">side of the debate</a> arguing that the current <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/17/business/dealbook/inflation-questions-experts.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation is temporary</a>, he grants that even an economy that’s back to normal by summer would “give heartburn” to the Biden administration. And there’s good reason for that: As the chart below shows, steep inflation has coincided with several sharp downturns in presidential approval since at least 1960. Biden himself is currently in the dumps as far as his approval rating goes.</p>

A <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/194241" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1999 study</a>, for instance, found that increases in unexpected inflation hurt incumbent parties’ electoral performance. And a 2010 paper showed that inflation had a <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/229403218_Rally_Round_the_Flag_Events_for_Presidential_Approval_Research" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly negative effect</a> on Americans’ evaluations of the president. Finally, a <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/73163/1/745263526.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2013 paper</a> found that, along with increases in the budget deficit and unemployment, an increase in inflation “cause[d] a deterioration of presidential popularity” in the United States.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But some prices are just more important than others when it comes to inflation. Consider <a href="https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_pri_gnd_dcus_nus_w.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rising gas prices</a>: A <a href="https://pprg.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Presidential-Approval-and-Gas-Prices.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2016 paper</a> found that higher gas prices had a negative effect on presidential approval, in part because Americans are constantly reminded of them. <a href="https://carolabinder.sites.haverford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carola Binder</a>, a professor of economics at Haverford College who researches inflation expectations and monetary policy, told me that high gas prices are particularly likely to affect how Americans evaluate the economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“You literally see gas prices and big numbers as you’re driving down the road, and you also purchase it more frequently,” said Binder. “So you’re more likely to remember how much it used to cost if you saw it last week was $2 and now it’s $3.” Binder said the same isn’t true of, say, the price tag of a family vacation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans who lived through the inflation of the 1970s, however, are also more likely to react negatively to steeper gas prices. Per a <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3267721" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 paper</a>, Binder and her co-author Christos Makridis found that Americans who lived through the oil crises of the 1970s were more pessimistic about rising gas prices than those who didn’t. That’s because, as Binder put it, “they formed their model of how the economy works based on how it worked back in the late ’70s.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling further confirms that Americans are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feeling the strain of rising prices</a>. Forty-five percent of households reported facing either “moderate” or “severe” hardship because of rising prices, according to a November <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357731/inflation-causing-hardship-households.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gallup poll</a>, and 56 percent of voters in a November <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-poll-biden-inflation-voters-11638897374" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wall Street Journal survey</a> said inflation was causing a “major” or “minor” financial strain on them. That strain has been particularly hard on poorer Americans, too; according to that Gallup poll, 7 in 10 adults in households earning less than $40,000 a year said the pandemic was causing them hardship. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though inflation weighs heavily on the American conscience, it’s important not to overstate its influence, especially on presidential approval. The chart above, for instance, shows George W. Bush’s approval falling during the Great Recession, a period of deflation. And even Carter’s reelection was doomed by a number of other key issues, both <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2019/11/04/the-iranian-hostage-crisis-and-its-effect-on-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign</a> and domestic. But that doesn’t stop Americans from dwelling on inflation, even when it is low. And, right now, there’s evidence that price hikes are hurting many Americans.</p>



<h2><strong>Americans’ views of inflation are strongly shaped by politics</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though inflation affects all Americans, there’s a gulf in perception. In short, whether you share a party affiliation with the president likely looms large for just how bad you think inflation will get. That tracks more broadly with how Americans’ views on the economy increasingly have <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-pessimistic-views-on-the-economy-have-little-to-do-with-the-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little to do with the economy</a> itself; rather, they’re about who’s in office. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“When the president of your political party is in power, you tend to be more optimistic about how the economy will be and tend to have lower inflation expectations,” said Binder. “When a president whose politics you disagree with is in power, you tend to be more pessimistic about how the economy will be, and you’re going to have higher inflation expectations.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jmcb.12797" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recent research</a> has borne that out, too, finding that Americans expect significantly lower inflation when the party they support is in the White House. According to a <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/213588/1/1680036254.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2019 paper</a>, inflation expectations were higher in red states than in blue states when Barack Obama was in office, only for the positions to reverse when Donald Trump arrived. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This trend has existed for a while, too. In the 1980s, for instance, when inflation had fallen nearly 10 points under Reagan, more than 50 percent of “strong” Democrats <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/1558352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that inflation had gotten somewhat or much worse in a 1988 survey, while fewer than 8 percent said it had gotten much better (13 percent and 47 percent of “strong” Republicans, respectively, said the same). Meanwhile, according to a study conducted near the end of another GOP administration, Bush’s in 2008, Democrats were <a href="https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w19080/w19080.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once again more likely</a> than Republicans to say inflation had increased over the past eight years. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unsurprisingly, this schism is also evident today: Under Biden, Republicans have <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357731/inflation-causing-hardship-households.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">consistently</a> reported <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/357617/economic-concerns-hit-pandemic-high-low-historically.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greater fears</a> about <a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2021-12-09/ap-norc-poll-income-is-up-but-americans-focus-on-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the economy</a> — and <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/17/inflation-economy-voters-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation</a> — than Democrats, and it doesn’t appear that divide is going away anytime soon.</p>



<h2><strong>The cure for inflation may be disastrous</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">On a surface level, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2019/11/income-inequality-getting-worse/601414/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inflation is<em> </em>bad</a>. If you <a href="https://bostonreview.net/articles/misreading-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hold all other things constant</a>, it erodes purchasing power and the value of your dollar. And if Biden gives the appearance of doing nothing, then fears of inflation <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/personalfinance/2021/11/11/wage-price-spiral-possible-inflation-consumer-price-index-rise/6390947001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may become a self-fulfilling prophecy</a>: Americans, anticipating higher costs, could demand higher wages from employers to offset inflation, which would then lead employers to demand higher prices, resulting in even worse inflation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The problem is that the solution — economic and political — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/05/25/what-scaremongering-about-inflation-gets-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t as simple</a> as raising interest rates to bring down inflation: There’s a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/us/politics/us-inflation-remains-low-and-thats-a-problem.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost to keeping inflation rates low</a>, and we’ve often been too quick to pump the brakes on a recovering economy.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We only talk about inflation when it’s higher, and not as much when it’s lower,” said <a href="https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/mcas/departments/political-science/people/faculty-directory/jonathan-kirshner.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jonathan Kirshner</a>, a professor of political science at Boston College who studies the politics of inflation. But he stressed that whether inflation is high or low, policies that target it end up picking winners and losers in the economy. “There’s no escaping the politics of inflation policy, even when inflation is at very low levels,” Kirshner added.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, some of the policies designed to deal with inflation — especially when it’s high — have had devastating effects. Take, for instance, the policies set in motion by the Carter administration that eventually stamped out inflation in the 1980s. For starters, the country <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/09/business/paul-a-volcker-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went into a deep recession</a>, and millions of workers lost their jobs. Disaffected building contractors and construction workers even mailed <a href="https://www.moaf.org/exhibits/fed/100/volckerwood" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chunks of two-by-fours</a> to the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors, claiming the wood was no longer needed because no one was buying houses anymore. The political fallout from inflation didn’t stop with Carter either. Reagan also saw his approval rating tumble even as inflation got under control. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/now/federal-reserve-we-got-it-wrong-on-postcrisis-rate-hikes-201428730.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more recent episodes</a>, such as the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-REB-36300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slow recovery from the Great Recession</a>, have further called into question the merits of being ultra-tough on inflation. Kirshner pointed to the double-dip recession of the 1930s as a consequence of being too quick to fight the inflation bogeyman. Inflation, of course, hasn’t yet approached the runaway levels of the 1970s, but there is a possibility that we <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/12/inflation-pandemic-fed/620971/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">course-correct too quickly</a>, as we did in the 1930s and 2010s. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/high-inflation-political-landmine-fivethirtyeight-politics-podcast-81734506</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">And that could pose a big problem considering that most other economic indicators that characterized the country’s 1970s “stagflation” aren’t present. In fact, the American economy has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/16/business/retail-sales-october.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recovered</a> strongly according to a number of measures: Unemployment <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is falling rapidly</a> — though workers continue to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/12/08/october-employees-quitting-jolts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quit their jobs</a> en masse — retail spending has increased, and households <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/06/upshot/inflation-psychology-economy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have saved more</a> than would have been expected in a non-pandemic world (though there’s some evidence that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/pandemic-savings.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">those savings are falling</a>). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this means that Biden is stuck between a rock and a hard place. He has to address very real concerns about an overheating economy while also being careful not to overreact to prices that may stabilize as things get back to normal. Meanwhile, roughly half of the country will appraise the economy relatively critically as long as a Democrat is in office, which complicates Biden’s approach. What’s good for the economy in the long term may not be good for his political and electoral concerns in the nearer term, and vice versa. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People like me think that in the short-to-medium run, at least, you have to let this inflationary wave pass through the economy,” said Kirshner. “Is that good politics? I suspect it’s terrible politics. But you’re selecting from a menu of unpalatable choices, and especially in the current political environment, whatever unpalatable choice you make will be vilified by the opposition.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Back in 2018, a quartet of Democratic women — known commonly as “<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/23/squad-congress-how-aoc-omar-tlaib-and-pressley-got-name/1804557001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Squad</a>” — broke barriers on their way to Congress: They were young women of color with no prior congressional experience who, in some cases, bested a white incumbent to represent their now racially diversifying districts. They were heralded as the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/opinion/the-squad-democrats.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">future of the Democratic Party,</a>” and, <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/rashida-tlaib-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-dsa-democratic-socialists-of-america" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for the progressive movement</a>, which had long struggled to make inroads with nonwhite voters, they offered a potential path forward: These four women, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/aoc-squad-are-getting-some-company-here-s-who-joining-n1250958" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and others like them</a>, would motivate people of color to vote for left-leaning candidates to help usher in a seismic shift in electoral politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/21/progressive-democrats-reset-449496" target="_blank" rel="noopener">then the 2020 election</a> happened. The Squad <a href="https://www.instyle.com/politics-social-issues/177th-congress-squad-cori-bush-jamaal-bowman" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>did </em>grow by two members</a>, but progressives failed to win the ultimate prize, the Democratic nomination for president, in large part because voters of color threw their support behind now-President Biden. In addition, many Democrats argued after the 2020 general election that progressive messaging might have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/democrats-2020-autopsy-midterms/2021/05/18/6114af82-b80d-11eb-a5fe-bb49dc89a248_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost Democrats seats in the House</a> that year. And while a handful of nonwhite progressive candidates <a href="https://www.governing.com/young-progressives-of-color-win-many-but-not-all-mayoral-contests" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have won important elections this year</a>, 2021 also contained a number of high-profile setbacks for the movement. Not only did Eric Adams, a Black moderate, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/election-2020-government-and-politics-209b2feb740ea6db4d3a2277e8fb38d6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">handily defeat a number of progressives</a> in the Democratic primary for New York City mayor, but <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/11/buffalo-election-2021-results-india-walton-defeated.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful</a> of other <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/how-shontel-brown-beat-nina-turner-ohio-primary_n_6116e717e4b01da700f5cb85" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressives of color</a> lost their races to more moderate politicians of color, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As a result, the buzz over the Squad’s initial wins in 2018 has largely been replaced by a narrative that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/26/us/politics/progressives-black-latino-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressives struggle with people of color</a>, and that Black voters especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-so-many-black-voters-are-democrats-even-when-they-arent-liberal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prefer more moderate candidates</a>. But the truth lies somewhere in the middle. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We looked back at the Squad’s initial primary wins, and found that they’ve often won sizable blocs of nonwhite voters, especially when they have had strong ties to those communities (or at least stronger than their opponent). But at the same time, they haven’t necessarily performed well with all voters of color in their district. In fact, our analysis found that — despite each member’s very different path of Congress — each Squad member’s wins required a multiracial coalition of both white and nonwhite voters. We only found one instance without a clear racial pattern. But even if there is no surefire strategy for progressives to win voters of color, the Squad’s primaries also push back against the idea that progressives consistently struggle with these voters.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The first member of the Squad — and arguably still the most famous — is Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Few thought the Democratic primary for New York’s 14th Congressional District on June 26, 2018, would be competitive, but Ocasio-Cortez wound up pulling off an upset, defeating then-Rep. Joe Crowley, the fourth-ranking Democrat in the House, 57 percent to 43 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In seeking to explain the result, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/ocasio-cortez-just-did-democrats-a-big-favor/2018/06/27/dafdc498-7a4c-11e8-aeee-4d04c8ac6158_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">commentators</a> at the time <a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2018/07/midterms-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-won-in-part-because-of-demographics-and-thats-a-good-thing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed to</a> the district’s changing demographics: Ocasio-Cortez, like 47 percent of the 14th District’s voting-age population, is Hispanic, while Crowley, like only 23 percent of the district’s VAP, is non-Hispanic white.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="3" href="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All demographic data in this article is from the 2020 census.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a> However, this explanation doesn’t tell the whole story as Ocasio-Cortez performed well in both white and Hispanic corners of the district. According to <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean McElwee</a>, the co-founder and executive director of Data for Progress, Ocasio-Cortez “benefited from a situation where very highly engaged liberal people were the big constituency that were turning out.”</p>

She defeated Crowley 64 percent to 36 percent in precincts with a white VAP of at least 60 percent. She also won heavily (70+ percent) Hispanic precincts, 56 percent to 44 percent. “She had liberals, particularly liberal whites and young whites, and Hispanic voters and that was her successful coalition,” McElwee said. But that isn’t to say that Ocasio-Cortez was able to appeal to all voters of color. The data suggests, and McElwee agreed, that Ocasio-Cortez performed less well with Black voters. Crowley actually won the district’s two Black-majority precincts by a 55 percent to 45 percent margin.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png" alt="Rashida Tlaib" class="wp-image-321216" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-TLAIB.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Rashida Tlaib</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">A few weeks after Ocasio-Cortez, the second member of the Squad eked out a win in her primary. On Aug. 7, 2018, former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib edged out Detroit City Council President Brenda Jones, another woman of color, in the regularly scheduled Democratic primary for Michigan’s open 13th District, 31 percent to 30 percent.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was also a concurrent special election to fill the remainder of Rep. John Conyers’s term, and Jones actually won that primary 38 percent to 36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This was a close, crowded primary — <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/michigan-house-district-13-primary-election" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four other candidates were in the running</a> — but to an even greater extent than Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib won thanks to her strength in precincts with large white populations. She received 42 percent of the vote in the district’s 34 precincts with white VAPs greater than 80 percent. However, this doesn’t show a complete picture: 13 of those precincts were in Dearborn Heights, which has a significant Arab American population, and the U.S. Census Bureau considers Arab Americans to be white. (Tlaib herself is Arab American.) Tlaib won 69 percent of the vote in these 13 precincts versus 26 percent of the vote in the other 21 heavily white precincts, so it’s likely that much of Tlaib’s apparent strength with white voters is in fact due to her base of support in the Arab American community.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1352" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-321194" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.2.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Tlaib also did not do particularly well in Black neighborhoods; she received 24 percent in precincts with Black VAPs greater than 80 percent. But that probably had more to do with Jones’s deep roots in Detroit’s Black community than Black voters explicitly rejecting Tlaib. Having served on the city council since 2006, Jones had fairly high name recognition in the city, and she won 41 percent in those 80+ percent Black precincts (almost all of which are in Detroit).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, given the racial composition of the 13th District’s VAP — 53 percent Black, 35 percent white — Tlaib would have likely lost if the Black vote had not been split among Jones and other candidates. “Rashida did get some support among African Americans, but it wasn’t the lion’s share of her vote,” said <a href="https://clasprofiles.wayne.edu/profile/ad4799" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Bledsoe</a>, a professor of political science at Wayne State University and former Michigan state legislator. Instead, Bledsoe said, Tlaib won thanks to her <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2018/07/16/who-raising-most-money-michigan-congressional-races/788580002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong fundraising</a>, which helped her air broadcast TV ads when no other candidates did, and her appeal to younger, more diverse voters. “There was a more progressive element to Rashida’s campaign,” said Bledsoe. “Brenda is certainly no conservative, but Rashida was talking in a more aggressive way about the progressive agenda and I think that helped mobilize young people.” </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png" alt="Ilhan Omar" class="wp-image-321214" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-OMAR.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Ilhan Omar</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Squad gained its third member on Aug. 14, 2018, when then-state Rep. Ilhan Omar won the Democratic primary for Minnesota’s open 5th Congressional District with 48 percent of the vote. A big reason for Omar’s success was that, as the first Somali-American state legislator in the U.S., she was already somewhat of a household name, both in the 5th District and around the country. Not only did she <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/a-muslim-woman-also-got-elected-last-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeatedly speak out</a> against then-President Trump, but a year prior to her 2018 congressional election, <a href="https://www.twincities.com/2017/09/07/minneapolis-rep-ilhan-omar-featured-on-time-magazine-cover/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she was featured on the cover</a> of Time Magazine. She was also featured in a <a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2018/05/31/ilhan-omar-maroon-5-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">music video for Maroon 5</a>, appeared on <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7025140/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Daily Show</a> and was the subject of a documentary that premiered at the <a href="https://tribecafilm.com/festival/archive/time-for-ilhan-2018" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tribeca Film Festival</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That national profile proved hard for any of her opponents to cut through. “All of [Omar’s primary opponents] had a hard time making the case against voting for someone who was already an international figure. It was hard to penetrate and no one quite landed on the right message,” said <a href="https://twitter.com/javimorillo?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Javier Morillo</a>, a political strategist who works in Democratic politics.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps unsurprisingly given her name recognition, Omar performed well in all corners of the 5th District. In fact, there was no correlation between a precinct’s racial composition and its level of support for Omar. In precincts whose Black VAPs exceeded 40 percent, Omar received 47 percent of the vote. In precincts where the non-Hispanic white VAP was at least 80 percent, she received 44 percent. Her best precincts spanned Minneapolis’s white-majority University neighborhood, heavily Somali Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and diverse Powderhorn neighborhood.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Omar was also the only member of the Squad to face a competitive primary in 2020. Antone Melton-Meaux, a moderate attorney, mounted a bid against her, and even though both Melton-Meaux and Omar are Black, that race actually broke down much more closely along racial lines. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps contrary to expectations, though, it was the progressive candidate who did better in Black neighborhoods. Omar won the primary overall, 58 percent to 39 percent, but she lost precincts with the highest white VAPs; Melton-Meaux defeated her 55 percent to 43 percent in parts of the district with white VAPs of at least 85 percent. Rather, Omar prevailed thanks to her strong performance in more racially diverse neighborhoods. She did especially well in precincts that were 40 percent Black or more, defeating Melton-Meaux 73 percent to 23 percent.</p>

Finally, he noted that media coverage of Omar’s first primary did not focus much on her progressive views, which may have made those moderate voters more willing to vote for her in 2018 than they were in 2020. “​​If she had that reputation she has now … I don’t know how that primary would have played out.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Rep. Ayanna Pressley is the fourth original member of the Squad, and she also performed well in all corners of her district, but it was actually Black precincts that gave her, a Black woman, the highest levels of support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On Sept. 4, 2018, Pressley <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-ayanna-pressleys-upset-win-in-massachusetts-isnt-really-like-alexandria-ocasio-cortezs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeated then-Rep. Michael Capuano</a>, a white incumbent who had served for nearly 20 years, 59 percent to 41 percent in the Democratic primary for Massachusetts’s 7th District. That 18-point margin is evidence that Pressley held her own everywhere, but she significantly outperformed Capuano, 76 percent to 24 percent, in the district’s 38 majority-Black precincts, mostly located in the Roxbury and Mattapan neighborhoods of Boston.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1354" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png" alt="" class="wp-image-321196" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.4.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Why was Pressley so successful in those areas? She had represented them for nearly nine years on the Boston City Council. And according to <a href="https://mavotertable.org/team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Beth Huang</a>, the executive director of the Massachusetts Voter Table, Pressley’s deep roots in the community went over well with voters of color in general. “She had many validators in communities of color who had known her for a long time,” Huang said. “She also targeted a wider set of voters, including more young people and more people of color in Boston.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But on top of that, Pressley was successful at expanding her appeal to whiter sections of the district, which ultimately elevated her candidacy even further. Per our analysis, she actually edged out Capuano, 51 percent to 49 percent, in the district’s 28 precincts with VAPs that are at least 70 percent white, reflecting her strength with young progressives in areas like <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2018/09/07/somerville-changing-and-are-its-voters-just-ask-ayanna-pressley/fbwXyuAGpTJIs2yTE93Y3M/story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Somerville</a> and Allston. But as Huang made clear, Pressley’s win was years in the making. “She was — and is — a very well-known quantity,” Huang said. “She put in the work for 10 years to build a lot of credibility with many different types of voters.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="500" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png" alt="Jamaal Bowman" class="wp-image-321212" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/SQUAD-BOWMAN.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><h2 class="has-text-align-center"><strong>Jamaal Bowman</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Squad originally consisted of just the four congresswomen mentioned above, but on June 23, 2020, it got a new member: Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who defeated former Rep. Eliot Engel in the Democratic primary for New York’s 16th District, 55 percent to 41 percent. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the 16th District abutting Ocasio-Cortez’s, Bowman prevailed by following Pressley’s template of running up the score in heavily nonwhite neighborhoods. Engel, a white man who had represented the 16th District since 1989, won 51 percent to 45 percent in precincts with VAPs that are at least 70 percent white. But Bowman, a Black man, won 59 percent to 34 percent in Hispanic-majority precincts and 63 percent to 34 percent in Black-majority precincts.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1378" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png" alt="" class="wp-image-321197" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.5.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Bowman didn’t have Pressley’s advantage of already being an elected official in the district, but according to McElwee (who advised Bowman during his campaign), he still had “real ties to civic and other institutions in the Black communities.” As a former school principal, McElwee said, Bowman was able to use his ties to the voters — particularly Black and Hispanic voters — to “upset the normal advantages that incumbents would otherwise have.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another thing that likely helped Bowman’s candidacy <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/us/politics/eliot-engel-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was a gaffe Engel made</a> after Floyd’s murder and subsequent racial-justice protests, where he essentially said that he only sought press attention on the issue because of his upcoming primary race. Engel’s comment that “if I didn’t have a primary, I wouldn’t care” may have signaled to Black voters especially that he didn’t share their community’s concerns over police brutality.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, the newest member of the Squad, Rep. Cori Bush, punched her ticket to Congress on Aug. 4, 2020, when she narrowly defeated then-Rep. Lacy Clay, 49 percent to 46 percent, in the Democratic primary for Missouri’s 1st Congressional District. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bush’s path to victory was unusual among Squad members in that she actually <em>lost</em> the parts of her district with the highest concentration of voters who share her racial identity. Bush, who is Black, lost the district’s Black-majority precincts 54 percent to 43 percent. But there is an easy explanation for this: The Clay family had been an institution in St. Louis’s Black community for over 50 years. Clay’s father represented the <a href="https://history.house.gov/Oral-History/Rainey/Representative-Clay-Sr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">district for 32 years</a>, and the younger Clay had served the area in either the state legislature or Congress continuously since 1983.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1372" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png" alt="" class="wp-image-321198" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/samuels-rakich.SQUAD_.1122.6.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In fact, one of the big reasons for the closeness of this race was Clay’s existing ties to older Black voters. According to <a href="https://twitter.com/JeffSmithMO?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jeff Smith</a>, a former Democratic state senator who represented a significant portion of the 1st District, Bush struggled a bit when it came to appealing to these voters since they had become accustomed to supporting the Clay name.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, it’s not like Bush didn’t attract <em>any</em> Black support: Her 43 percent performance in Black-majority precincts is actually pretty impressive considering the strength of her opponent. Indeed, Smith said, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/congresswoman-elect-cori-bush-reflects-black-lives-matter/story?id=74760158" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bush had strong ties</a> to the Black activist community who wanted to elect a more progressive representative following the 2014 shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, which is part of the 1st District. “Bush’s district is really the epicenter for the modern civil rights racial justice movement post-Ferguson, so that nurtured a cadre of young activists that powered her campaign,” Smith said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Where Bush really excelled, though, was in whiter parts of Missouri’s 1st District. In white-majority precincts, she defeated Clay 54 percent to 38 percent, and she turned in some of her strongest performances in the gentrified neighborhoods of St. Louis like those around Tower Grove Park. And it’s possible the Clay name might have also worked in Bush’s favor in conservative, white enclaves of the city. Smith suggested that some white voters might have voted for Bush as a protest vote against the Clay name. “A longstanding distrust of the Clay machine in some of those places probably helped her even though, ideologically, those wards are closer to him than her.” But Bush’s real base in this primary was white progressives, Smith said. </p>



<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">In sum, the Squad members’ coalitions have been all over the map. While some members (Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib and Bush) did better in whiter precincts, others (Pressley and Bowman) did better in predominantly nonwhite areas. And in one case (Omar) there was no obvious pattern (at least in her initial election). </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even with these differences, though, it’s clear that voters of color aren’t an automatic vote for the establishment-aligned candidate (as Capuano, Engel and Melton-Meaux can attest). Instead, in all the Squad’s primaries, it seems that voters of color opted for the candidate who had a deeper connection to their respective communities. And that shouldn’t be surprising. It makes a lot of sense, actually: Voters vote for the representative who they feel best represents them.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This article is a collaboration between FiveThirtyEight and </em><a href="http://fullerproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Fuller Project</em></a><em>, a nonprofit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main" class="has-drop-cap">Sarah Caswell is stressed about her job every day. The science and special-education teacher in Philadelphia sees things going wrong everywhere she looks. Her high school students have been falling behind during the COVID-19 pandemic, the students and even the teachers in her school rarely wear masks, and a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/philadelphia-shooting-2021-lincoln-high-school-20211018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shooting just outside her school</a> in October left a bystander dead and a 16-year-old student in the hospital with critical injuries. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She’s unhappy. But her solution isn’t to quit — it’s to get more involved.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We need to double down,” Caswell said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">She isn’t the only one who thinks so. Throughout the past year, surveys and polls have pointed to an oncoming crisis in education: a mass exodus of unhappy K-12 teachers. Surveys from unions and education-research groups have warned that anywhere from <a href="https://www.nea.org/advocating-for-change/new-from-nea/safety-concerns-over-covid-19-driving-some-educators-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-fourth</a> to <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/more-than-half-of-teachers-considering-leaving-the-classroom-301289190.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than half</a> of U.S. educators were considering a career change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Except that doesn’t seem to have happened. The most recent statistics, though still limited, suggest that while some districts are reporting significant faculty shortages, the country overall is not facing a sudden teacher shortage. Any staffing shortages for full-time K-12 teachers appear far less severe and widespread <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/would-you-manage-70-children-and-a-15-ton-vehicle-for-18-an-hour/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than those for support staff like substitute teachers, bus drivers and paraprofessionals</a>, who are paid less and encounter more job instability.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a female-dominated profession, these numbers notably contrast trends showing that <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-relationship-between-school-closures-and-female-labor-force-participation-during-the-pandemic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women in particular</a> have been leaving their jobs at high rates throughout COVID-19. While labor-force participation for women dropped significantly at the start of the pandemic, and <a href="https://nwlc.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/September-Jobs-Day.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still remains about 2 percentage points below pre-pandemic levels</a>, teachers by and large seem to be staying at their jobs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So, why have the doomsday scenarios not come true? There are many explanations — and the ways they overlap tell us something about the state of American schools, the inner workings of America’s economy and the way gender shapes the American workforce.</p>


<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1231771321.jpg" alt="A teacher gestures to her class of mask wearing students" class="wp-image-320953" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1231771321.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1231771321.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1231771321.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1231771321.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1231771321.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p class="photo-credit credits">Jon Cherry / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main" class="has-drop-cap">By many accounts, teachers have been particularly unhappy and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/why-teachers-leave-or-dont-a-look-at-the-numbers/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed out</a> about their jobs since the pandemic hit, first struggling to adjust to difficult remote-learning requirements and then returning to sometimes unsafe working environments. A <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA1108-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nationally representative survey of teachers</a> by RAND Education and Labor in late January and early February found that educators were feeling depressed and burned out from their jobs at higher rates than the general population. These rates were higher for female teachers, with 82 percent reporting frequent job-related stress compared with 66 percent of male teachers. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the survey, 1 in 4 teachers — particularly <a href="https://www.edutopia.org/article/why-black-teachers-walk-away" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black teachers</a> — reported that they were considering leaving their jobs at the end of the school year. Only 1 in 6 said the same before the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the data on teacher employment shows a system that is stretched, not shattered. In an <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-bad-are-school-staffing-shortages-what-we-learned-by-asking-administrators/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EdWeek Research Center report</a> released in October, a significant number of district leaders and principals surveyed — a little less than half — said that their district had struggled to hire a sufficient number of full-time teachers. This number paled in comparison, though, with the nearly 80 percent of school leaders who said they were struggling to find substitute teachers, the nearly 70 percent who said they were struggling to find bus drivers and the 55 percent who said they were struggling to find paraprofessionals. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg" alt="A kindergarten teacher preps her classroom" class="wp-image-320958" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1309678670.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p class="photo-credit credits">Yalonda M. James / The San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">More concrete jobs data suggests that school employees have largely stayed put. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, fewer public-education professionals quit their jobs between the months of April and August the past two years than did so during that same time immediately before the pandemic. In 2019, around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10092019.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">470,000 public-education employees quit their jobs</a> between April and August compared with around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10062020.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">285,000 in the same period in 2020</a> and around <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/jolts_10122021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">300,000 in 2021</a>. Notably, this data includes both full-time teachers, support staff and higher-education employees, though teachers make up a majority of those included, says Chad Aldeman, policy director of Edunomics Lab, an education-policy research center, at Georgetown University. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Experts point to multiple reasons for this trend. While women have been disproportionately affected by mass COVID-related job losses, teachers haven’t faced the types of widespread layoffs experienced by workers in other professions — including other types of public school employees like bus drivers. Moreover, relative to other types of jobs disproportionately held by women, teachers have more job stability and receive more generous benefits. Educators often get into their work for specifically mission-driven purposes, too, making them uniquely positioned to decide to stay at their jobs, even during particularly stressful periods, experts say. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The early indicators we have show turnover hasn’t spiked this year as we anticipated,” said Aldeman. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, he said, data shows that the hiring crunch might be because there are more jobs to hire for. Vacancies have increased, suggesting that districts might be beefing up hiring after a year of uncertainty and an influx in federal aid. In other words, labor shortages are not totally attributable to increased turnover. And while <a href="https://chicago.chalkbeat.org/2021/9/10/22666840/covid-stress-chicago-public-schools-teachers-stay-put-vacancies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early data</a> on <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/education/ny-teacher-retirements-pandemic-20210830-7uhkzispm5akxf6mraygjxlclm-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teacher retirements</a> suggests that there might have been increases on the margins in some places, fears of mass retirements have not borne out so far. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg" alt="A substitute teacher helps a student during class" class="wp-image-320954" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1235587559.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p class="photo-credit credits">Terry Pierson / The Press-Enterprise via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Still, some local districts are hurting. Sasha Pudelski, the assistant director for policy and advocacy for the School Superintendents Association, has spoken to school leaders around the country who are facing teacher shortages, sometimes at crisis levels. But her sense is that these shortages are uneven depending on a district’s resource level and how well they’re able to pay. Based on what she’s heard from school-district leaders, she suspects shortages are more acute in low-income communities with a lower tax base for teacher salaries, potentially causing a further shortage of educators from underrepresented groups, who disproportionately teach in these areas. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, <a href="https://4f730634-e809-4181-92d7-ed1dc705414a.filesusr.com/ugd/1394b9_7709c1ab926247469c2aa9c076b977bc.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fall 2021 study</a> of school-staffing shortages throughout the state of Washington shows that high-poverty districts are facing significantly more staffing challenges than their more affluent counterparts. In some places, there are significant numbers of unfilled positions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Study co-author Dan Goldhaber, who directs the Center for Education Data &amp; Research at the University of Washington and serves as a vice president of the American Institutes for Research, is cautious about drawing conclusions about such an abnormal year. But he believes that fears of teacher shortages in the past have been overblown, pointing to a study by the Wheelock Education Policy Center at Boston University, which found that teacher-turnover rates in Massachusetts remained largely stable throughout the <a href="https://nam10.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwheelockpolicycenter.org%2Feffective-teachers%2Fcovid-19-and-ma-teacher-workforce%2F&amp;data=04%7C01%7Cdgoldhaber%40air.org%7C35aa3baf2e2f468e0ea608d9a1f86aed%7C9ea45dbc7b724abfa77cc770a0a8b962%7C0%7C0%7C637718910633329236%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=a6wr9mYyqpFTXcKn1iBX9JdJ03qD%2FX%2FrIt2cqKNgCq0%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2020-21 school year</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I have seen three different waves of people talking about teacher shortages, and I’ve seen policy briefs come out that suggest there are going to be 100,000 to 200,000 slots that can’t be filled for teachers,” said Goldhaber. “Those kinds of dire predictions have never come to pass.”</p>


<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main" class="has-drop-cap">Rather than lean out, a significant number of teachers have become more engaged in workplace issues amid the turbulence. Evan Stone, the co-founder and co-CEO of Educators for Excellence, points to recent union elections in multiple cities that have seen unprecedented turnout. In late September and early October, for example, nearly 16,000 United Teachers Los Angeles members <a href="https://www.utla.net/news/utla-members-approve-agreement-lausd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in a vote over school-reopening issues</a>, while <a href="https://utlaelections.org/results/2020-election-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">less than 6,000 voted in a 2020 election</a> of union leaders. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the American Federation of Teachers saw a slight increase in membership this year. Randi Weingarten, the union’s president, traveled across the country this fall to get a sense of how her members were feeling.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Every place I went, yes, there’s trepidation, a lot of agita over the effects of COVID, but there’s a real joy of people being back in school with their kids,” said Weingarten. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, this increase in union participation isn’t across the board. The National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers union, has lost around 47,000 members, or about 1.6 percent of its membership, since this point last year, according to figures the NEA supplied to FiveThirtyEight and The Fuller Project. The organization attributes most of the losses to a decline in hiring at the higher-education level and decreased employment for public K-12 support staff.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg" alt="The Providence Teachers Union holds a rally for safe school reopening" class="wp-image-320952" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1228544578.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Some teachers unions have rallied for stronger safety protocols to help protect teachers and students. <p class="photo-credit credits">Barry Chin / The Boston Globe via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">For teachers like Caswell, the past two years have driven her to get more involved with her union, unhappy as she may be at her job and unsafe as she may feel. (A spokesperson for Philadelphia public schools notes that the district has an indoor mask mandate that all individuals are expected to follow.) For a single mother supporting three kids, quitting isn’t an option. Caswell can’t imagine switching schools within the same district either, even though she describes her work environment as miserable. Her students, some of whom she’s worked with for years, mean too much to her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Instead, Caswell has started working to organize members in her school to represent their interests on a larger level and effect change. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I can’t just walk out, though there’s definitely moments where I would have liked to,” said Caswell. “We’re tired. The demands keep coming, and we can’t do it all.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">She sees her advocacy as directly related to her gender, believing the profession receives less support and resources than it deserves because the composition of the workforce is largely female. Indeed, union representation, and the perks that come along with it, is something that other sectors facing massive shortages of female workers, like service and hospitality industries, don’t necessarily receive. As of 2017, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/participation-in-teachers-unions-is-down-and-likely-to-tumble-further/2017/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">about 70</a> percent of teachers participated in a union or professional association, according to federal data. By comparison, the same is true for only about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/health/covid-health-workers-unions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17 percent of nurses</a>, another predominantly female workforce. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Female professions are undervalued by society, and I think that’s part of the reason teachers are <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/union2.t03.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more densely organized</a> than almost any other worker in America right now,” said Weingarten. </p>


<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>



<p data-paragraph="main" class="has-drop-cap">Still, plenty of teachers are quitting — and they’re quitting at least in part because of the pandemic. According to a survey by the RAND Corporation, almost half of former public school teachers who left the field since March 2020 cited <a href="https://www.rand.org/news/press/2021/02/22.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID-19 as the driving factor</a>. The pandemic exacerbated already-stressful working conditions, forcing teachers to work longer hours and navigate a challenging transition to remote learning. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For some teachers, the decision to quit was easy. High school science educator Sara Mielke, who had recently returned to teaching after taking time off to stay home with children, quit her job several weeks into this school year over the lack of COVID-safety protocols in her Pflugerville, Texas, school. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I felt like I couldn’t trust these people to prioritize safety in general,” said Mielke, who adds that she was chastised by school administrators for showing her students accurate information about vaccine effectiveness and enforcing the school’s mandatory mask policy. (The district did not respond to a request for comment.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other teachers say that while they wanted to leave, the prospect of saying goodbye to their students was too much. So, they decided to stay and push for changes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="709" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg" alt="Students hold signs during a drive by parade for Teacher Appreciation Week" class="wp-image-320951" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1211994687.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p class="photo-credit credits">Jessica Rinaldi / The Boston Globe via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">That was part of the calculation for Kiffany Cody, a special-education teacher in Gwinnett County, Georgia. She took a stress-related medical leave of absence last year, in part because she felt her district was neglecting worker safety. But Cody returned to the classroom after several months, noting she is “really, really, really passionate about the kids.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year she’s banded together with other educators to speak out about unsafe working conditions and start tracking violations of district safety protocols. They’ve become close friends, a support group who feel determined to hold their district accountable and make schools kinder and safer for students and staff. (A representative from Gwinnett County schools said that the “district follows the CDC recommendations for schools regarding layered mitigation strategies, isolation, and quarantine guidelines to promote a healthy and safe environment for our students, staff, and visitors.”)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Every now and then, Cody looks at LinkedIn and ponders working in another field. But for now, she’s in it for the long haul — for her students. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We’re trying to work within the system to do what we can to help the students,” said Cody. “We can leave and find jobs in other districts and industries, but at the end of the day, the kids can’t go anywhere.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In a normal election year, Richard Leonardon, 60, would be supporting a Republican or independent political candidate. But during at least one race in his lifetime, Leonardon broke his habit. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was 1996, when he was living in Pennsylvania’s 14th District, long represented by William Coyne, a Democrat. The Republican candidate, Bill Ravotti, didn’t really stand a chance of defeating Coyne, but Leonardon still couldn’t bring himself to vote for Ravotti. Instead, Leonardon wrote his own name on the ballot.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That year, the only other candidate on the ballot was Paul Scherrer of the Socialist Equality Party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a> That’s because, as a gay man, Leonardon found certain <a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/19981024debate5.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments Ravotti made about gays and lesbians</a> unsettling. Leonardon stressed that “someone does not have to be very ‘pro-gay’ to get my vote.” He just doesn’t want politicians to espouse openly anti-gay views, adding that his policy when assessing political candidates is generally “I won’t discuss it if you won’t discuss it.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the fact that Leonardon voted for a Republican even once — and has continued to support Republican or independent candidates — is notable because most lesbian, gay and bisexual voters tend to identify as Democrats.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FiveThirtyEight did not look at transgender Americans’ political beliefs for this story. Polling data for this segment of the electorate is sparse; plus, whether someone is transgender is separate from their sexual orientation. We also were not able to look at the political beliefs of Americans who identify as queer because of a lack of polling data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a> Lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans still represent a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/329708/lgbt-identification-rises-latest-estimate.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">small share of the adult population</a> (about 5 percent), but a 2016 <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-voters-remain-a-solidly-democratic-bloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center</a> study found that 82 percent of LGB voters identified as or leaned Democratic while only 18 percent identified as or leaned toward the GOP. Moreover, LGB voters were much more likely than the electorate overall to hold broadly liberal political beliefs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, there’s still a small but growing number of LGB voters who are loyal to the GOP. This is true for many reasons, but one of the biggest threads I stumbled upon in my interviews and research is that many LGB Republicans see their sexuality and politics as separate. They’re also more likely to factor normal GOP dogma — favoring lower taxes, less federal government intervention and some restrictions on abortion — into their identity. On top of that, most believe that the party <em>has</em> changed a lot in its treatment of same-sex couples. During his presidential campaign in 2016, for example, Donald Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/trump-who-cast-himself-as-pro-lgbt-now-under-fire-from-democrats-for-rolling-back-protections/2019/05/30/95c04e96-8306-11e9-95a9-e2c830afe24f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made overt appeals</a> to LGBTQ voters, and ahead of the 2020 election, he <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/26/us/politics/trump-lgbtq-rights.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced an LGBTQ coalition</a>, with Richard Grenell, the openly gay U.S. ambassador to Germany at the time, <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/05/26/grenell-to-join-trump-campaign-283026" target="_blank" rel="noopener">campaigning on Trump’s behalf</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">More generally speaking, Republican voters also seem to have changed their attitude toward issues like same-sex marriage. <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Gallup</a>, which has been tracking Americans’ support for marriage equality since 1996, a record-high 70 percent of all adults now believe that same-sex marriage should be recognized by the law and that same-sex couples should have the same rights as opposite-sex couples who are married. And for the first time ever, a majority of Republicans (55 percent) also say they support same-sex marriage. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="816" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-320766" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Historically, though, many LGB voters have tended to lean Democratic because the Republican Party has <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/16/republicans-gay-marriage-wars-505041" target="_blank" rel="noopener">actively campaigned against LGB rights</a> and, in some cases, the LGBTQ community itself. In 2003, then-Sen. Rick Santorum, who would go on to run for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012 and 2016, notoriously <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2015/07/23/politics/rick-santorum-homosexuality-comments-same-sex-marriage/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likened homosexuality to pedophilia and bestiality</a>, and in his 2004 reelection bid, then-President George W. Bush called for a constitutional amendment to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/06/05/same.sex.marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ban same-sex marriage</a>, something he proposed again in 2006. These examples aren’t some relic of how the GOP used to operate either. In October, just before he was elected governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin said he <a href="https://19thnews.org/2021/11/glenn-youngkin-virginia-marriage-equality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was personally opposed to same-sex marriage</a>. And even Trump, for all his courting of LGBTQ voters, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/07/politics/justice-department-colorado-cake/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sided with the Colorado baker</a> who argued in a 2018 Supreme Court case that his religious beliefs were <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/law/2018/jun/04/gay-cake-ruling-supreme-court-same-sex-wedding-colorado-baker-decision-latest" target="_blank" rel="noopener">justification for not making wedding cakes</a> for same-sex couples. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://turnbulldugarte.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stuart Turnbull-Dugarte</a>, a political science professor at the University of Southampton who has done research on how sexual identity affects vote choice,<strong> </strong>noted that this not-so-distant history is one big reason why there’s a strong correlation between identifying as LGB and voting Democratic. “The Democrats, while being slow on endorsing [same-sex marriage] pre-Obama, have always been the more pro-LGB of the two parties, and LGB voters have rewarded these pro-LGB stances by awarding Democratic candidates with their votes on polling day,” he told me. Turnbull-Dugarte added that even in cases where Democrats are somewhat lukewarm on issues related to LGBTQ rights, they’re still often more open compared with Republicans. “Between a silent Democrat and an anti-gay Republican, LGBs know which candidate is going to improve — or at least not damage — their welfare.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, there are signs that the GOP is making inroads with this bloc: <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/10/25/lesbian-gay-and-bisexual-voters-remain-a-solidly-democratic-bloc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Pew</a>, which used exit polling data, 22 percent of LGB voters backed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney in 2012, while 24 percent backed Republican candidates during the 2014 midterm elections. Some estimates also suggest that Trump won as much as 27 percent of the LGBT vote in 2020 — which, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/01/had-lgbt-voters-stayed-home-trump-might-have-won-2020-presidential-election/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if true, would be the highest share of support</a> any Republican presidential nominee has ever received from this group.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I think I’m accepted in the Republican Party. A lot of Republicans don’t like gays, but they say, ‘What you do is your own business,’” Leonardon said. “I don’t feel the Republican Party has an anti-gay bias nearly as much as it used to, particularly because the older Republicans have died off and the ones 50 and under just don’t care as much.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It’s true that younger Republicans are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-some-socially-liberal-gen-z-voters-arent-leaving-the-gop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close to their Democratic peers</a> in supporting LGBTQ rights. But there’s still a tension some LGB Republicans must grapple with when navigating their political identity: While the GOP writ large has gradually <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/350486/record-high-support-same-sex-marriage.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">softened its stance</a> on same-sex marriage, the six people I spoke with still have to square existing within a party where <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2017/06/27/there-is-now-a-dramatic-generational-divide-over-white-evangelical-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some prominent voting blocs like white evangelical Christians still don’t <em>fully </em>embrace</a> the sexual orientation of LGB Americans — and where party leaders sometimes still espouse <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/06/09/metro/republican-who-made-anti-gay-remarks-says-she-wont-be-bullied-into-resigning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homophobic sentiments</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On top of that, a few people told me that it’s hard for them to feel accepted within larger LGBTQ communities due to their political beliefs. But, for the most part, how much they feel the need to address that tension runs in tandem with how central being lesbian, gay or bisexual is in their life.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Being a gay conservative, you always find yourself hiding one part of yourself from another and switching in between these two communities and never being able to find that balance,” said E.A., a 24-year-old in Washington, D.C., who asked to be identified by his initials out of fear of retribution for his beliefs and sexual orientation. “I can’t speak for other people, but for my friends and I, this is something we commonly run into.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">E.A. isn’t alone on this. Several people I spoke to said it’s easier to be lesbian, gay or bisexual in Republican circles than a Republican in LGBTQ+ circles. That may have to do with one of the biggest differences between LGB Republicans and LGB Democrats: that most LGB Republicans see their sexuality as separate from — or secondary to — their political identity. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">According to an October 2020 study from the <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgb-party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law</a>, 54 percent of LGB Republicans said their sexual orientation was an insignificant<em> </em>part of who they are compared with 38 percent of LGB Democrats who felt the same. Conversely, 85 percent of LGB Democrats said that being LGB was a “very important” aspect of themselves versus 68 percent of LGB Republicans.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1292" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-320770" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samuels.LGTBQ-Republicans.1111.2.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">“While most LGBs are strong Democrats, the minority who do ‘break ranks’ with the group tend to have a lower sense of identification with the LGB identity,” said Turnbull-Dugarte. “These are likely to be people who, whilst they may have a same-sex partner, might not necessarily be participants in gay culture or be fans of ‘RuPaul’s Drag Race.’”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Leonardon told me he fell into this bucket. “My sexual orientation being gay is just a tiny part of me and doesn’t really affect where I stand politically,” he said. “I think the Democratic Party tends to pander too much to various groups, and I think we should look at people more as individuals than as part of a group.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">E.A. agreed. “I don’t see someone’s sexuality as a defining factor of one’s character or personality. I see my sexuality as a part of me, as I would see my arm or any other facet that creates who I am. It doesn’t define whether I lean more left or right,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another important distinction, Turnbull-Dugarte noted, is that LGB Republican voters are far less likely to view society as being biased or discriminatory toward the LGBTQ+ population. “In other words, they do not share the claims of the LGBTQ+ ‘collective’ as being a group subjected to systematic marginalization,” he said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s true that in my interviews, many said they didn’t think Republicans were actively vilifying them anymore. Moreover, some said that the party simply didn’t talk about same-sex marriage as much as it used to. “I feel like gay rights isn’t an issue now since it’s pretty much settled,” said Nestor Moto Jr., a 26-year-old gay Republican living in California. “The court has already decided.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that doesn’t mean being in the GOP still isn’t without difficulties. Some of the people I spoke with felt as if they had to hide or suppress parts of their identity because they worried about being alienated either due to their sexuality or their politics. This is something the Williams Institute study suggested was a <a href="https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/lgb-party-affiliation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common sentiment shared among</a> LGB Republicans versus LGB Democrats. Per its research, 46 percent of LGB Republicans (compared with 72 percent of LGB Democrats) said they felt like a part of the LGBT community. Meanwhile, only 45 percent of LGB Republicans (and 70 percent of LGB Democrats) said they felt a bond with the LGB community. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I spoke to Alex P., a 32-year-old bisexual man living in California who does not want his last name used due to privacy concerns. He told me he’s happily married to a woman with whom he’s open about his struggles, but beyond that, only a few close friends and family members know about his sexual orientation. He added, however, that due to his religion and political beliefs, he’s never acted as he says “outwardly gay”  — even though he’s been inclined to do so.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I didn’t really come to terms with my bisexuality until I was in my mid-20s, but I’m also a Christian and I believe the Bible is authoritative,” he said. “My personal preferences are secondary to that.” He added, however, that he thinks some conservatives “are not compassionate” toward people who are not heterosexual. “One of the errors conservatives make is they assume because one is LGBT, that makes one a liberal or someone who doesn’t care about the morality of their sexual behavior. My hope is that society would understand that LGBT people are not a uniform bloc and that some do not view their sexuality as their primary identity.”</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">E.A., meanwhile, said he’s run into issues explaining his politics and sexuality with people on dating apps, in particular. “There’s been a number of times where I’ve interacted with people and the first question is, ‘Well, you’re not a Republican, right?’” he told me. “On Hinge, if you have ‘moderate’ in your profile, it means you’re conservative. There’s small, nuanced things one always has to navigate as a gay Republican, and I don’t think straight Republicans or gay Democrats have to worry about that.” Moto said he’s run into similar issues: “It’s easier to tell Republicans that I’m gay than to tell gay people I’m a Trump supporter. I lost a couple friends back [in 2016] and people were very hostile; that’s one reason I got out of politics because I didn’t want people to continue to harass me.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But of the LGB Republicans I spoke with, none seemed to hold any deep-seated resentment toward the GOP over negative interactions they’ve had regarding their sexuality. In fact, they all seemed to really agree with the party’s message, and many said they also thought that Democrats had gone too far left in recent years. Leonardon, for example, told me he’s been loyal to Republican or independent candidates because he prioritizes other issues — “tax issues, government-regulation issues [and] free-speech issues.” Meanwhile, Barb Hauxwell, a 61-year-old lesbian from Oklahoma, said she’s firmly pro-Trump and would never go back to voting for Democrats (which she did before she and her sister took over her family’s business). “I’m fiscally conservative. I’m still a Christian — it doesn’t matter whether I’m gay or not. I’m against abortion,” she said. “Pretty much everything the conservative party is for, I’m with them.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, LGB Republicans make up a small slice of the LGBTQ+ community and an even smaller slice of the electorate, but for now at least, the Republican platform seemed to hold more weight for them than any negativity and vilification they might experience because of their sexuality. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Hauxwell put it bluntly: “Sex is only a small part of our lives, and now that I’m older, I don’t even have it, so it doesn’t matter.”</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">You can see it at the grocery store, the gas station and your heating bill (though, mercifully, <a href="https://qz.com/2087483/alcohol-and-air-travel-resisted-high-us-inflation-in-october-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not at the liquor store</a>): Prices are getting higher. Since October of last year, prices for consumer goods have risen 6.2 percent — the biggest year-over-year increase since 1990 — according to <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report released Wednesday</a> from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Prices are on the rise in nearly every category, including gas, food and housing, <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/how-the-supply-chain-caused-current-inflation-and-why-it-might-be-here-to-stay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">largely as a result</a> of supply chain disruption, labor shortages and lingering effects of the pandemic. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Despite <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2021/11/10/22775092/inflation-cpi-october-economy-biden-fed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a mix</a> of <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/10/economy/consumer-price-inflation-october/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">coverage</a> in the media, the prevailing message from officials seems to be “don’t panic.” The Federal Reserve <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/with-bond-buying-taper-bag-fed-turns-wary-eye-inflation-2021-11-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predicts this period</a> of rising prices to be “transitory,” and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/11/10/1054019175/inflation-surges-to-its-highest-since-1990" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there are signs</a> that price increases are <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/inflation-may-cool-off-in-november-and-december-shipping-data-suggests.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting to slow</a>. But in the meantime, Americans are worried about inflation, and most blame the Biden administration, according to recent polls. It’s why Biden <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-10/biden-says-addressing-rising-inflation-is-a-priority-for-his-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched gears this week</a>, going from celebrating the passage of his bipartisan infrastructure bill to addressing inflation concerns. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you haven’t noticed prices going up, you’re in the minority. Seventy-six percent of U.S. adults said gas prices had gone up “a lot,” and 65 percent said food prices had gone up “a lot,” according to <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/87gqotkd1s/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Economist/YouGov poll</a> conducted Nov. 6-9. One in four Americans said they spent more on groceries in October, compared with September, <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 3. And <a href="https://scottrasmussen.com/77-have-recently-experienced-sharp-price-increases-while-shopping/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Scott Rasmussen national survey</a> conducted Oct. 11-13 found that 77 percent of registered voters had “recently experienced sharp increases in the cost of items they would like to buy.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are also anticipating prices to continue to rise, especially as we head into the holiday season. In <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/expected-price-hikes-food-travel-tech-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a different Morning Consult poll</a>, which was conducted Oct. 29 through Nov. 1, a majority of Americans anticipated prices for consumer tech, food, travel, toys and jewelry would be higher this year than in previous years, and planned to compensate for the increase by hunting for deals. As the holidays approach, consumers have been most concerned about the cost of meat, produce and dairy, according to the <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/08/grocery-holiday-budget-supply-chain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first Morning Consult poll</a>. Forty-eight percent of Americans were “very concerned” about the cost of meat, 37 percent about produce and 33 percent about dairy. A plurality of consumers (46 percent) said they “often” compared prices to reduce their grocery costs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are not happy about these price increases. In a <a href="https://civiqs.com/documents/Civiqs_DailyKos_monthly_banner_book_2021_10_h82c93.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Daily Kos/Civiqs poll</a> conducted Oct. 30 through Nov. 2, 78 percent of registered voters said they were dissatisfied with the price of gas (only 5 percent said they were satisfied) and 75 percent said they were dissatisfied with the price of consumer goods like food, clothing and household items. This dissatisfaction about the price of consumer goods was highest among Republicans, at 92 percent, compared with 57 percent of Democrats and 78 percent of independents. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans are feeling the price increases in their pocketbooks. That Economist/YouGov poll found 56 percent of Americans said it was at least somewhat difficult to afford gas, with 55 percent saying the same about food and 48 percent saying the same about housing costs. <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2021/10/Fox_October-16-19_Complete_National_Topline_October-21-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Fox News poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-19 showed concern about inflation was higher than it’d been for the past four months, with 87 percent of registered voters saying they were “very” or “extremely” concerned about inflation and higher prices.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Increased prices can <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/08/05/1024139056/inflation-is-a-big-political-test-for-president-bidens-economic-agenda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impact voters’ political views</a> of the economy overall because their effects are felt so immediately, contributing to <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-rating/?ex_cid=rrpromo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s negative approval rating</a>. “There is a psychology to inflation that is different from everything else, and it tends to drive how people view the economy because they experience it every day whether it is at the grocery store, gas pump or buying household goods,” John Anzalone, a Democratic pollster, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/politics/story/2021-11-10/biden-says-addressing-rising-inflation-is-a-priority-for-his-administration" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the Los Angeles Times</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Polling captures how voters are thinking about inflation as a political issue. A plurality of registered voters (40 percent) said the Biden administration’s policies were “very responsible” for the inflation, and a majority (62 percent) said the administration’s policies were at least “somewhat responsible,” <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2021/10/20054637/2110084_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to a Politico/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Oct. 16-18. In a <a href="https://harvardharrispoll.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/HHP_October2021_Topline.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Harvard/Harris poll</a> conducted Oct. 27-28, 56 percent of registered voters said they weren’t confident in the Biden administration’s ability to keep inflation at bay, and 53 percent said the same about the Federal Reserve’s ability. A majority (56 percent) said that Congress passing a $1.5 to $2 trillion social spending bill (such as <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/manchin-repeats-worries-about-inflation-amid-final-social-spending-bill-n1283670" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the one they’re currently trying to pass</a>) would lead to more inflation. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While the public reaction is out of step with expert forecasts, their fears should not be brushed aside. Some economists theorize that, left unchecked, fears about inflation can make the situation worse <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/inflation-expectations-and-what-it-could-mean-for-markets-bmo-capital.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by creating a self-fulfilling prophecy</a> in which employees, afraid of rising prices, demand higher wages, the costs of which employers would then cover through raising prices, leading to higher inflation. This is <a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22576069/inflation-1970s-volcker-powell-federal-reserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what happened in the 1970s</a>, and it led to nearly double-digit inflation rates. Regardless of how transitory the Fed thinks these price increases will be, Americans are worried right now.</p>



<h2><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>The 2022 midterm elections are a little less than a year away, and an endorsement from Biden, whose approval rating is low, may not be an attractive option for all candidates. Most likely voters (51 percent) said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate endorsed by the president, per a <a href="https://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/november_2021/most_voters_say_biden_endorsement_would_hurt_local_candidates">Rasmussen Reports poll</a>. </li><li>Americans <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/08/politics/cnn-poll-biden-job-approval/index.html">aren’t satisfied</a> with how Biden has handled what they say is the nation’s top issue: the economy. A plurality of Americans (36 percent) said the economy was the most important issue in the U.S., according to a <a href="http://cdn.cnn.com/cnn/2021/images/11/08/rel7a.-.politics.pdf">recent CNN/SSRS poll</a>. And a majority (58 percent) said Biden hadn’t paid enough attention to the country’s most important problems. </li><li>COVID-19 cases have <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/10/after-weeks-of-declines-us-covid-cases-have-leveled-off-at-a-high-level-the-ers-are-packed.html">stopped declining in the U.S.</a>, but many Americans are ready to return to pre-COVID life. Per a <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">recent Axios/Ipsos poll</a>, a small majority of Americans (55 percent) thought returning to their pre-COVID lives now came at a small risk or no risk to their health, and 50 percent of Americans said they felt they were at less risk of contracting COVID-19 now, compared with April 2020. </li><li>About <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/white-house-900000-kids-virus-shots-1st-week-81080149">900,000 children ages 5 to 11 received their first dose</a> of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine just one week after the vaccine was approved for that age group. Before the vaccine was approved, an October <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-october-2021/">Kaiser Family Foundation poll</a> found just 27 percent of parents with children ages 5 to 11 said they would vaccinate their kids “right away” once eligible. That hesitancy was in large part about the long-term effects of the vaccine in children (76 percent of parents surveyed) and that their child might have serious side effects from the vaccine (71 percent).</li><li>On Monday, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/08/travel/usa-travel-restrictions.html#:~:text=The%20United%20States%20reopened%20its,of%20dollars%20in%20tourism%20revenue.">the U.S. lifted a travel ban for vaccinated visitors</a> from 33 countries, including Mexico, Canada and the United Kingdom. But some international travelers don’t feel comfortable traveling to the U.S. A <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/11/04/international-travel-united-states-covid/">Morning Consult poll</a> found that 60 percent of Canadian adults didn’t feel comfortable planning a trip anywhere in the U.S. and 41 percent of Mexican adults are uncomfortable. In Europe, 45 percent of adults in the United Kingdom, 42 percent in Germany and 36 percent in France were uncomfortable planning a trip to the U.S. </li></ul><h2><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main"><em>This article is a collaboration between FiveThirtyEight and </em><a href="http://fullerproject.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>The Fuller Project</em></a><em>, a nonprofit newsroom reporting on issues that affect women.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main" class="has-drop-cap">One day last spring, Naima Kaidi waited nearly an hour for her kindergartener and first-grader to get home from school. She stood on the corner near her house, but the bus was nowhere to be seen and there was no word why it was so late. Northport Elementary in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, had only recently reopened for in-person classes, and day after day, Kaidi’s family had been struggling with late school bus drop-offs. This day was the worst. Cold and worried, she eventually carried her younger children back home to get her phone and try to find out what was going on — and that was when she got a knock on the door. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It was Roberta Steele, who had driven the school bus in Kaidi’s neighborhood for years, there to bring the two children home. Steele knew where the kids on her route lived. She knew who their parents were. And even though it wasn’t her fault that the bus was late, Steele made sure the kids arrived home safely. “She helped me, she [brought] my kids over here,” Kaidi said. Even if the bus system wasn’t reliable, the driver was. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But that was last school year. Even then there was already a shortage of bus drivers in the district. Steele said that had been the case for years, though district representatives were quick to point out that there had never been a shortage of this magnitude. This fall, the shortage became dire enough that Steele’s old route — the one where she knew all the kids well enough to take them to their doorsteps when needed — was consolidated out of existence. In October, the district told parents that <a href="https://www.kare11.com/article/news/education/robbinsdale-area-schools-bus-driver-shortage/89-0e254e80-1e44-4171-97c9-6b2d509d1da6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12 routes probably wouldn’t be staffed</a> this year. Steele was transferred to a different route with new kids, and sometimes the chaos of route changes and late buses meant she also had to drive kids home from other, equally unfamiliar routes.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg" alt="A school bus drops off students" class="wp-image-320597" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL138-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The route that Steele drove for years was eliminated by the company that operates buses for the district. <p class="photo-credit credits">Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">It isn’t an easy job. The kids don’t behave. Some, unsure of their own addresses, can’t tell Steele where to go. When parents get angry at a system that isn’t working, they blame Steele. And the company that runs the buses has packed her schedule to the point that there’s no longer time left to pee between runs. She’s thinking of quitting, even though she knows that will make things even harder for the families relying on her.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, Kaidi’s family spent the first two months of school with no bus at all. Instead of waiting at her corner with other parents, she spent her afternoons sitting in her car in the pickup line outside school. The line backed up for blocks, 40 or 50 cars deep, threading out of the parking lot and down an undulating suburban road. Kaidi had to get there an hour before school ended just to make sure she was near the front. She says she turned down a job so she could do this. Likewise, other parents had to change their hours, lose pay and go without sleep — all to sit in their cars, waiting for their children. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As the bus driver shortage continues, parents and drivers, often women on both sides, have been stretched to the breaking point as they try to do more with less — less time, less money, less help, less of a sense of safety and respect. “This problem existed before COVID, but nobody wanted to hear about it, especially the school districts,” said <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10129300/whats-really-causing-the-decimation-of-the-school-bus-industry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zina Ronca</a>, a driver supervisor for DuVall Bus Service in West Grove, Pennsylvania, who has been <a href="https://stnonline.com/blogs/the-decimation-of-school-bus-contractors-and-the-school-bus-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the industry for nearly two decades</a>. There haven’t been enough school bus drivers nationwide for years. But it took a pandemic to make that shortage visible and painful to more than just the drivers themselves. </p>

Across the country, reports have documented shortages of substitute teachers, school nurses, cafeteria workers and the paraprofessionals who help teachers manage their workloads and give kids more small-group attention. As with drivers, those shortages existed before anyone had ever heard of COVID-19. The problems were there, waiting, and then the pandemic came along and made them simultaneously more visible and more … just <em>more</em>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All these jobs are about service and care, at pay scales that simply aren’t competitive with jobs that use similar skills but don’t require child care balanced precariously on top of other demands. And when the people who do those jobs quit, the effects get tangled up with other parts of the economy and other parts of society. Amid the pandemic, individual workers are making choices for themselves and their families that affect other people’s families and jobs in ways nobody quite expected. The bus driver shortage isn’t just a bus driver shortage — it’s a knot nobody knows how to cut. </p>

But in the third year of school disruption, it turns out that the bus driver is a person in your neighborhood whom you miss when you don’t see them every day. The job involves only a minimal amount of interaction, Roberta Steele told me. But it’s daily interaction. “You know you’re making a difference for some kids, and that brings me great joy,” she said. “I have kids that I had in middle school that are now in high school. And they will walk from the high school to the middle school just to say hi.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele, 50, is a barrel-chested woman with cropped, spiky hair the color of her last name. She comes off as perky and outgoing, basically the vibe of a favorite grade-school gym teacher. She doesn’t have kids of her own but places a lot of value in the role she can play in the lives of other people’s. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Steele has been driving a school bus since 2014, all of it for Robbinsdale School District 281, one of those sprawling suburban districts that encompass schools and children in multiple cities on the fringes of Minneapolis. She took the job after leaving the Minneapolis Police Reserve but almost quit in the first two years. The kids were just a lot. A typical school bus can carry 70 children when full. They get bored, or they just plain don’t know how to behave. “I resorted to bribery as a method of training,” she told me, using small treats to manage the threat of prepubescent uprisings. </p>

They were there before the pandemic and are still there now. <p class="photo-credit credits">Alex Kormann / Star Tribune via Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Today, she can quell most bad behavior with a look delivered through the rearview mirror. Her starting pay, driving a 15-ton vehicle down the winding, narrow roads of inner-ring suburbs while managing the behavior of a small village worth of kids, and for which she needed to take classes and earn a special license, was $14 an hour. “It’s really rewarding, or it can be, if you like children, right?” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But not everyone does. Or, at least, not at that price point. Steele’s entire bus driving career has been marked by not having enough colleagues. She told me she found the job in the first place because the district was recruiting heavily to fill a shortage, though representatives from the district stressed that they had never had a shortage like this before. Nationwide, more than 50 percent of districts have experienced a shortage of drivers every year since at least 2006, according to <a href="https://www.schoolbusfleet.com/10003422/how-school-bus-driver-shortage-is-linked-to-unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">annual surveys conducted by School Bus Fleet magazine</a>. Most years, the driver shortage affected more than 70 percent of districts. The lowest the shortage has been in all that time was in the depths of the Great Recession.</p>

But school bus drivers don’t work year-round, full-time hours. “We’re only guaranteed four hours of pay a day,” Steele said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are no paid holidays or sick days, she and other bus industry experts say. Benefits vary from company to company, and there’s no guaranteed work at all in summer. “Spring break is all unpaid. Every teacher-compensatory day, every snow day, any time they cannot pay us they will,” Steele said. She added that a recent, failed unionization effort among the Robbinsdale bus drivers started in part as a fight for snow-day pay. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL101-575.jpg" alt="Bus driver Roberta Steele sweeps out her bus" class="wp-image-320598" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL101-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL101-575.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL101-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL101-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL101-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p class="photo-credit credits">Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Working as a school bus driver means, essentially, needing another source of income. This is part of why the job has long attracted women — particularly mothers — who were able to work while their children were at school. In 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">58.5 percent of all school bus drivers were women</a>. The hours are predictable and short, with a gap in the middle of the day when your time is your own, during which some drivers earn money doing other jobs, like working as a mechanic for the bus company, or doing a different caregiving job in schools. And the job comes with unusual perks like the ability to take the bus home, turning the morning commute into a walk to the driveway. At some bus companies and school districts, drivers have the freedom to take their young children on the bus with them during their rounds — a chance to bring in money without adding to the ever-rising cost of day care. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it <a href="https://www.the74million.org/article/burgoyne-allen-5-things-to-know-about-americas-school-bus-driver-shortage-what-states-can-do-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doesn’t pay enough to live on</a>. For Steele, the job works only because her partner brings in a paycheck and benefits. Other drivers depend on a second job, performed between roughly 9 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., when they aren’t on the clock. LaShawn Favors, a bus driver in the Minneapolis suburb of St. Louis Park, had a second part-time job as a paraprofessional in a school while his wife worked from home in the health-care industry. His route didn’t overlap with where his own kids, who lacked reliable bus service, needed to go, so his wife and his daughter’s boyfriend were stuck shuttling the kids to and from school while Favors rushed from one job to another and back to the first.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Drivers spackle their work lives together this way, with voluntary overtime and luck, and they still struggle. <a href="https://bellwethereducation.org/publication/challenges-and-opportunities-school-transportation-today" target="_blank" rel="noopener">COVID didn’t make the job hard</a>, it just made it harder.</p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator has-text-color has-background is-style-dots" style="background-color:#999999;color:#999999"><p data-paragraph="main" class="has-drop-cap">Pay is the problem, and COVID made it worse by threatening the unique benefits that kept people driving buses, despite the low pay, to begin with. Older drivers suddenly had to deal with the increased risk of sickness and death, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/we-feel-your-grief-remembering-the-1-000-plus-educators-whove-died-of-covid-19/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">risks that haven’t really been properly calculated</a> anywhere.

<p data-paragraph="main">Other drivers had no real choice but to find other work during the long months when schools were remote and had no need of them, while drivers who were mothers found themselves trying to juggle home and work in a job they’d taken precisely so they wouldn’t have to do this in the first place. When schools moved to hybrid systems, the districts needed drivers every day, but those drivers’ own kids’ schedules may not have been in sync, said Erin Ducharme, vice chair of membership for the Women in Buses Council and an executive at Bloom Tour and Charter Services in Taunton, Massachusetts. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Nationwide, there have been reports of shortages of <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/09/06/school-cafeterias-are-looking-for-workers-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cafeteria workers</a>, <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/no-bus-drivers-custodians-or-subs-whats-really-behind-schools-staffing-shortages/2021/09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">custodians, substitute teachers</a> and <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/how-staff-shortages-are-crushing-schools/2021/10" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paraprofessionals</a>.

The bus driver shortage is part of a larger, longer problem in schools — one that extends beyond the school building. When “women’s jobs” go unfilled, other women, namely moms, pick up the slack — and the effects reverberate across the economy. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Low-paid caregiving jobs bind together a lot of big trends happening in the economy, said Abigail Wozniak, a labor economist at the Minneapolis Federal Reserve. And you can see those themes play out in the lives of the women whose children used to ride to school on Roberta Steele’s bus — and now have no bus service at all. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Take Amanda Swanson, a neighbor of Kaidi’s, who spent the first months of school making a point of being first in the hour-long pickup line every day at Northport Elementary. She’s supporting her family working as a manager at an Amazon fulfillment center while her husband stays home with their youngest children because child care is too expensive. He used to be able to walk the children to the bus stop. But after the bus stopped running, Swanson switched to an overnight shift and frequently left her job early so she could drive them in the family’s only car. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1365" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" alt="Bus driver Roberta Steele waits for students" class="wp-image-320593" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/MNCL132-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption><p class="photo-credit credits">Craig Lassig / AP IMAGES FOR FIVETHIRTYEIGHT</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Not long ago, Swanson (or her husband) would have been a prime candidate to <em>be</em> a school bus driver. Instead, she’s working a job that didn’t exist a decade ago but pays enough to keep her family solvent. It’s not just that school-support jobs don’t pay enough, it’s that they’re in direct competition for workers with jobs that pay more. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“At least since the 1970s, <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us-workers-real-wages-have-barely-budged-for-decades/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wages for the majority of Americans have barely budged</a>, and if anything <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R45090.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they've decreased for workers that don't have a college degree</a>,” said Krista Ruffini, a professor of economics at Georgetown University. Even before COVID-19, that squeeze is part of what has made jobs like bus driving less attractive today than they were 20 or 30 years ago, and it’s also put those jobs in competition with newer kinds of work — gig-economy jobs or delivery and warehouse jobs that require the same kinds of skills, pay the same or more, and require less emotional labor, Wozniak said. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="School bus drivers have other job options " aria-label="Bar Chart" id="datawrapper-chart-SHk3V" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/SHk3V/13/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="410"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">So far, these newer jobs are still a relatively small portion of all jobs and because of that probably can’t explain big, economy-wide trends. “But there will be some employers now who are competing with, basically, Amazon,” she said. A school bus driver could instead drive a delivery vehicle. School support staff like paraprofessionals and lunch ladies have logistics skills that are needed in a warehouse. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And when there’s a shortage of school bus drivers, that makes it hard for some parents to take a job. Once her children were finally old enough to be in school during the day, Kaidi had intended to go back to work this fall for the first time in years. But, she said, she’s received multiple job offers she couldn’t accept because of the time she has to spend ferrying her children to and from four different school buildings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Her conundrum makes it easy to understand how <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pandemic has disproportionately</a> affected <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/essay/why-has-covid-19-been-especially-harmful-for-working-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">women’s careers</a>. “On the female side of the labor market, we know that there's been an increase in people that say that they can't work because they're providing care,” Ruffini said. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/03/1002402802/there-are-complex-forces-keeping-women-from-coming-back-to-work" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Some have had to quit</a>; others just don’t reenter the workforce, even when they have an opportunity. That’s been a feature of the pandemic, affecting a wide swath of the kinds of service and emotional-labor jobs that disproportionately employ women — jobs like the ones in schools. Kaidi’s experience shows how shortages in one field can create or exacerbate shortages in another. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, many of the women who have stayed in their emotional-labor jobs are being pushed to a breaking point — women like Swanson and Kaidi’s neighbor Christiana Metzger, a nursing assistant who works nights and has been running on almost no sleep since the beginning of the school year in September. She described breaking the speed limit, exhausted, trying to get home fast enough to take her older children to class on time, preparing meals and picking kids up from school and checking their homework, and the headache she’d had for several days straight. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The jobs done by people like Metzger are what middle-level jobs look like today, said Nicole Smith, chief economist at the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce. Along with the lack of growth in real wages, there’s the idea that the job spectrum has hollowed out, leaving nothing but the worst-paying jobs and the ones that pay well but require college degrees. But that’s not exactly the case, Smith says. There are jobs left in the middle, but they’re no longer in manufacturing — they’re jobs that involve caring for people (like nurses) or supporting other workers (like school paraprofessionals). Again, women’s jobs. Jobs that continually conflict with women’s labor at home.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The emotional and psychological aspects of work are something economists are only just beginning to pay attention to, Wozniak said. But when shortages happen — whether through the cost-saving design of a lean staffing model or a chain of unfortunate events — it’s those intangible, immeasurable parts of a job that can quickly spiral out of control. “Now there are three people in the lunchroom instead of five or eight,” she said. “It’s the same job but not at all the same because you’re doing it faster and with less help.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The bus driver shortage is a pay issue, but it’s also clearly more than that. It’s about how your job treats you. It’s about what you’re expected to do outside of the office. It’s about the narrow space women are squeezed into where we need to be better paid for the hard work we do at caregiving jobs but also need other women to do caregiving jobs at a lower price we can afford. It’s about being forced to make a choice between fulfilling your responsibilities at work and getting your children home safely. And it’s about how schools do, and don’t, function.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At the end of October, Kaidi, Metzger and Swanson finally got bus service again. But they didn’t get it from Steele, who remains relegated to a different route, increasingly unhappy with the way the bus company and the district are treating her and other drivers. The immediate crisis ended for some of the moms of Brooklyn Center. But the problem isn’t solved. Not for the drivers. Not for the school districts suffering disruption on top of disruption. And not for the nation as a whole. “What’s going on in the labor market is something that we certainly haven’t seen in my lifetime,” Ruffini said. People have been out of work and out of their normal routines for a long time, she noted. Their responsibilities have changed at home. And so have the ways they spend their time and their resources. Nobody knows what happens next. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But we do know that what happens with bus drivers is going to affect what happens with a lot of other people. The pandemic didn’t create these shortages. But it made clear how inextricably linked one job is to a whole bunch of others — how our lives and livelihoods are lashed together with cords we can’t usually see. When a time of stress and tragedy makes those invisible bonds more tangible, we can’t go back to pretending they don’t exist. All we can do is try to untangle them together. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How Fast Is The Economy Recovering?<br />
By Julia Wolfe and Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux</p>
<p>For nearly a year, the economy has been on a long, exhausting slog toward post-pandemic “normalcy.” And it isn’t over yet.</p>
<p>This page — which we plan to update every month — will tell us how far we still have to go before the economy is back where it was before the pandemic shut down much of American life.</p>
<p>We have made significant progress, of course: After hitting the highest level of unemployment the country has seen since the Great Depression in April, the unemployment rate has steadily fallen.</p>
<p>But as of this month, we’re still 3.2 percentage points higher than the pre-pandemic unemployment rate.</p>

Dec.<br />
+11.3<br />
+3.2<br />
The unemployment rate in December was 6.7%, according to the latest jobs report, unchanged from 6.7% in November.</p>
<p>Crucially, the recovery isn’t affecting all workers equally. Just as Black and Hispanic communities have struggled with higher rates of infection and death since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, communities of color are continuing to bear the brunt of high unemployment and economic insecurity, even as the overall numbers fall.</p>

Even in good times, Black unemployment often hovers at levels much higher than for white Americans. But the pandemic has exacerbated that stubborn inequality, and now we’re in the midst of a profoundly unequal economic crisis. Low-wage workers — who are disproportionately likely to be Black and Hispanic — have been hardest hit by the pandemic because they generally work in sectors, like retail and hospitality, where their work can’t be done from home. Those workplaces pose significant public health risks in a pandemic, and have been subjected to full or partial shutdowns as infections ebb and flow.</p>
<p>As a result, we’re much closer to economic normalcy in sectors like construction and professional and business services than we are in sectors like leisure and hospitality.</p>

Some sectors have been able to adjust (more or less) to the realities of the pandemic, but others, like leisure and hospitality and education and health services, have left their workers in a painful no-win situation. They face precarious employment, with temporary furloughs or permanent layoffs always on the horizon, plus the unenviable prospect of going to work every day with the risk of infection hanging over their heads.</p>
<p>These disparities are important to remember because even when employment appears to be approaching pre-pandemic normalcy, a lot of people aren’t part of that economic rebound — and those workers are still disproportionately likely to be people of color, young and low-wage.</p>
<p>Check back next month for an update on how close — or far — we are to the levels of unemployment we saw before the pandemic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">All-out partisan conflict has jammed the gears in the U.S. Senate in recent years, causing a virtual standstill. We’ve seen the Republican Party <a href="https://www.npr.org/2018/06/29/624467256/what-happened-with-merrick-garland-in-2016-and-why-it-matters-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener">block a presidential nominee to the Supreme Court</a> without a hearing or vote. We’ve seen both parties <a href="https://www.senate.gov/legislative/cloture/clotureCounts.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasingly use the filibuster</a> when they’re in the minority to impede the opposition from passing legislation. And <a href="https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R43389.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we’ve seen a ratcheting up</a> of brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, which <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-markets-financial-institutions-and-fiscal-service/debt-limit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">establishes how much money the federal government can borrow</a> to pay its existing financial obligations. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The use of the debt ceiling as a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/in-debt-deal-the-triumph-of-the-old-washington/2011/08/02/gIQARSFfqI_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">legislative hostage</a> started in earnest in 2011, when a divided government in Washington <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2012/07/the-not-so-happy-anniversary-of-the-debt-ceiling-crisis/260458/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly caused a debt default</a>. Energized by the tea party movement, Republicans <a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/a-familiar-landmine-the-looming-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">refused to back an increase in the debt ceiling</a> unless then-President Barack Obama agreed to budget cuts, and they also refused to raise taxes as part of a bipartisan bargain. A last-minute agreement followed, but the delay still led to a downgrade in the country’s credit rating. Yet we’ve seen <a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/debt-limit-through-the-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continued clashes over the cap ever since</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those conflicts have escalated further in the current round. Although Democrats and Republicans <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/politics/debt-ceiling-congress-republicans.html?" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have just about reached a deal</a> to go ahead with a simple majority vote on a short-term debt ceiling increase, <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-calls-republicans-refusing-raise-debt-ceiling/story?id=80394658" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republicans remain intent on filibustering</a> a straight up-or-down vote on a longer-term suspension or increase of the limit in December. Democrats control the Senate, which is split 50-50, through Vice President Kamala Harris’s tie-breaking vote. But that’s well short of the 60 votes required by the filibuster to advance to a final vote.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What I see as new here is filibustering debt limit increases and forcing a Senate majority party that doesn’t have 60 seats to try to come up with some way to raise the debt ceiling — even though it doesn’t have 60 seats and can’t get any help from the minority party,” said <a href="https://politics.princeton.edu/people/frances-lee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frances Lee</a>, a political scientist at Princeton University who studies congressional politics.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Failing to raise the debt limit would result in a default on U.S. debt, which <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/01/economy/debt-ceiling-next-steps/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could cripple the economy</a> and <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#_Hlk431978571" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cause terrible repercussions for everyday Americans</a>. The date the country runs out of money is quickly approaching: Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/treasury-secretary-warns-calamity-congress-raise-debt-limit/story?id=80283655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> it could be as soon as Oct. 18. While the parties seem set on a short-term agreement to push that deadline back to at least December, Republicans continue to say that, for a longer-term increase, Democrats <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/republicans-play-debt-limit-brinksmanship-nation-barrels-default/story?id=80417215" target="_blank" rel="noopener">must raise the cap on their own</a> using the more complex <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/federal-budget/introduction-to-budget-reconciliation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconciliation process</a>, which allows passage of certain fiscal legislation with only a simple majority. And, while there are paths out of this predicament, this amplified disagreement is emblematic of the dangers the debt ceiling presents to our political system, especially <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-hatred-negative-partisanship-came-to-dominate-american-politics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when partisan enmity is so high</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Here, then, is a look at how we got here; what could prevent politicians from using the debt ceiling to put Congress in a political stranglehold; and why it’s unlikely that the debt ceiling will go away anytime soon.</p>

<h2><strong>How the battle over the debt ceiling escalated</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congress has always placed limits on federal debt, but it <a href="https://www.crfb.org/papers/qa-everything-you-should-know-about-debt-ceiling#established" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first established the debt ceiling</a> in 1917 over concerns about debt piling up during World War I. About two decades later, in 1939, <a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20151102_RL31967_4040b7fa5a66b382fbc01594e94477dfa8bacf46.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the cap came into its modern form</a> after modifications applied it to nearly all federal debt. The idea was that aggregating most debt would give the Treasury Department more flexibility to manage it while maintaining Congress’s <a href="https://history.house.gov/institution/origins-development/power-of-the-purse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">constitutionally mandated control of the nation’s finances</a>. Over time, the state of the debt ceiling has also come to symbolize the federal government’s frugality or wastefulness.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet the limit’s means as a check on spending is questionable considering that the national debt <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/FYGFD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has only gone up</a> since the late 1930s. More importantly, as a share of the nation’s gross domestic product, debt has surged since the 1980s, following a long-running decrease after World War II, as the chart below shows. In other words, the country’s <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/debtgdpratio.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">debt-to-GDP ratio</a> — a measure of our debt that factors in our ability to pay it off by looking at it relative to the size of the nation’s economy — has grown immensely.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="Both Republicans and Democrats own the national debt  " aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-Z8PQ5" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/Z8PQ5/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Who’s to blame? Well, both parties, and … circumstances. The steepest rises in debt-to-GDP ratio came during the presidencies of two Republicans (Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump) and one Democrat (Barack Obama). However, some of these increases happened partly because of crises. When Obama came into office during the Great Recession, a loss of tax revenues due to the economic downturn and a <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$831 billion stimulus package</a> led to <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/future-development/2018/06/25/10-years-later-4-fiscal-policy-lessons-from-the-global-financial-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large budget deficits</a>. And in 2020, during Trump’s presidency, <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/government-stimulus-efforts-to-fight-the-covid-19-crisis-4799723" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stimulus efforts to combat</a> the negative economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to a further rise. Yet much of this was of their own making, such as the <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/tax-cuts-wont-make-america-great-again" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tax cuts passed</a> during the presidencies of Reagan and Trump that ballooned deficits and increased the national debt.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s never been an easy vote, but Congress has raised the debt ceiling more than 100 times. Its history as a political tinderbox <a href="https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/146682/1/862691109.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long predates our current era</a>. “The debt ceiling has been a problem going back to the 1950s, because it’s difficult for Congress to support an increase,” said Lee. “It looks to their constituents like they are free spending, don't care about the deficit, that they're voting themselves a blank check. That's how it gets understood.” This misunderstanding of the debt ceiling -- which affects only our ability to pay what we already owe -- <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-americans-think-about-the-fight-over-the-debt-ceiling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to be a problem</a>, too, as many Americans still mistakenly believe it authorizes new spending.</p>



<h2><strong>What’s different in the latest debt-ceiling fight</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Prior to this current fight, if one party had full control but lacked 60 seats in the Senate, the minority party <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/psq.12066" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn’t block the majority from advancing</a> debt ceiling legislation. With a looming deal to allow a short-term increase, that has remained true -- for now. But later this year, Republican opposition may compel Democrats to raise the cap on their own <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2021/09/22/potential-fallback-for-debt-ceiling-fraught-with-complications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using reconciliation</a>, a special legislative process that requires just a simple majority but can only be used sparingly. While <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/09/27/democrats-reject-grueling-debt-limit-514256" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not unheard of</a> to increase the limit via reconciliation, having the minority <em>force</em> the majority to raise it this way is new.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://gai.georgetown.edu/laura-blessing-ph-d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laura Blessing</a>, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute who studies budgetary politics, viewed this fight as potentially “a new era of just insane levels of brinkmanship” because there doesn’t appear to be any path to a bipartisan agreement on a long-term debt ceiling increase. Blessing noted that it was then-Vice President Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell who came together at the last minute to salvage things in 2011. But McConnell “has changed his tune in terms of how he thinks the debt ceiling should work,” she observed, as he now argues the party in power has sole responsibility for raising it. “And there is not, at least not publicly, any sort of negotiating position that [Republicans are] using this for,” said Blessing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It seems that de facto, they're attempting to slow down the Biden administration legislative train by putting this kind of a roadblock in the works. It’s just the most dangerous roadblock that you can possibly imagine.”</p>

</div>



<h2><strong>Why it’s going to be hard to remove the debt ceiling cudgel from our politics</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we’ve seen, the debt ceiling has done little to reduce federal spending, in part because the cap affects the country’s ability to pay off already-existing financial obligations and is handled separately from legislation that actually authorizes expenditures. Additionally, the debt ceiling has provided opportunities for partisan maneuvering that can take us to the brink of default. So it’s probably past time to rethink the debt ceiling. “You've got this fiscal tool that is antiquated and can only harm people and that <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/22684328/us-debt-ceiling-government-shutdown-biden-democrats" target="_blank" rel="noopener">virtually no other country around the world has</a>,” said Blessing. “You could procedurally blunt this.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One move would be to reinstitute some version of the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/debt-ceiling-reconciliation-partisan-budget-negotiations-spending-federal-deficit-11629753688" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gephardt Rule</a>, which from 1979 to 1995 linked an increase in the debt ceiling to the passage of the budget. When Congress passed its fiscal plan, it simultaneously authorized any necessary borrowing. But after the GOP captured all of Congress in the 1994 election, it mostly did away with this rule. Unfortunately, reinstating this rule might not be enough, in part because the budgetary process <a href="https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/its-not-news-congresss-budget-process-wreck-it-should-be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hasn’t functioned properly</a> for years now. “The federal budget process has been broken for the past 10 years. We have not passed a budget resolution most of the time,” observed Blessing. “So even if you went back to a classic fix, that classic fix would be a problem because things have broken down so much.” In fact, after Democrats captured the House in 2018, <a href="https://www.rollcall.com/2019/01/03/rules-package-would-renew-gephardt-rule-with-a-major-twist-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they implemented a new version of the Gephardt Rule</a> that suspends the debt limit rather than establishing a new ceiling. That hasn’t fixed things, partly because the Senate still has to approve of the suspension. Blessing said that Senate rules could also be adjusted to include something similar to the Gephardt Rule, but that could be difficult to do in such a narrowly divided chamber.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In a similar but more ambitious vein, Georgetown University law professor David Super <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/09/20/only-language-mcconnell-understands-is-power-act-accordingly-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has argued that</a> Senate Democrats could use a stand-alone reconciliation vote to pass legislation that directly ties the debt ceiling to whatever the national debt happens to be. And with Senate Republicans opposed to assisting a long-term debt ceiling hike, Democrats <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1445111822483345411" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may indeed have to raise it</a> via reconciliation. In a bit of good news for Democrats, though, Punchbowl News <a href="https://email.punchbowl.news/t/ViewEmail/t/DD8030506F7149122540EF23F30FEDED/0D79378D1BBC29E51D419C9787CC9684" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported earlier this week</a> that the Senate parliamentarian has ruled that a separate reconciliation vote on the debt ceiling wouldn’t disrupt Democrats’ ongoing legislative efforts to pass a large social spending package, which is also being done via reconciliation. Democrats could try to mimic Super’s plan or raise the debt ceiling to an astronomically high number that would essentially make it meaningless for the foreseeable future. Democratic Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky, chairman of the House Budget Committee, <a href="https://about.bgov.com/news/debt-creativity-includes-mint-the-coin-gazillion-dollar-limit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said in late September</a> that he was in favor of “eliminating the law or raising the debt limit to a gazillion dollars.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, it’s not clear whether Super’s approach or raising the debt ceiling to an extreme might be palatable to many Democrats, who may instead prefer a smaller increase. “It's a painful vote for members of Congress,” said Lee. “They don't want to have to vote for it because it makes them look irresponsible to their constituents.” And sure enough, Republicans are licking their chops at the prospect of using this vote in the 2022 midterms, especially by linking it to the Democrats’ ambitious spending plans. For instance, Florida Sen. Rick Scott, who leads the National Republican Senatorial Committee, <a href="https://twitter.com/sahilkapur/status/1441066579496685568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a> that the committee’s midterm election ads will hit Democrats on a debt limit increase.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And therein lies the rub with the debt ceiling: It’s really a political tool, not a fiscal instrument. “A reason why it's hard to reform is that it's a valuable mechanism for forcing a conversation about deficits and gives Congress leverage to demand concessions,” said Lee. “In the case of unified government, it’s the chance for the party out of power to make some political headway against the party in power, to say they're governing in an irresponsible manner.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, even if many Democrats want to change how the debt ceiling works, Blessing pointed out that such a reform could be too much for members of Congress to take on while Democrats are also trying to pass a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/democrats-will-be-disappointed-party-pares-agenda-white-house-2021-10-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still-developing social spending plan</a>. “I don't see them having the bandwidth to do that right now,” said Blessing. “You're asking a lot of people to take votes that are going to make them a little squeamish, particularly for well-known and moderate Democrats, and asking them to deal with debt limit reform on top of that. That is kind of a big ask.” The short-term deal to raise the debt ceiling does give Democrats a little more space to work out the party’s exact social spending legislation, but it’s unclear <a href="https://email.punchbowl.news/t/ViewEmail/t/C16F789594BD16622540EF23F30FEDED/CFF70EDA230965EECE63909E3969C05F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whether they’ll have enough time</a> to finish those deliberations before the debt issue once again becomes pressing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet another wrinkle is that the Republican filibuster of a long-term debt ceiling hike has also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/06/us/debt-ceiling-filibuster.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reanimated discussions</a> within the Democratic caucus over changes to the traditional filibuster. Some Democrats, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/politics/biden-debt-ceiling-filibuster/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">including President Biden</a>, have raised the idea of altering the rules to allow a simple majority vote to raise the debt ceiling, or even something less specific, such as a <a href="https://twitter.com/lindsaywise/status/1445487774698672132" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-day elimination of the filibuster</a>. However, West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema <a href="https://www.vox.com/22319564/filibuster-reform-manchin-democrats-nuclear-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have publicly opposed</a> changes to the filibuster rules. And earlier this week, Manchin <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1445122612665933826?s=21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed back</a> on adjusting the filibuster for a debt ceiling hike. Still, Lee wondered if there may have been some calculation by the Democratic leadership in not trying to address the debt limit earlier this year, even though everyone knew well ahead of time that the fight was coming. “This is not a surprise, so why are they letting it come to crisis now at the same time as they have to deal with the infrastructure bill and the reconciliation negotiations on the Build Back Better plan?” asked Lee. “I'm totally speculating, but it is a pressure point for the filibuster.” The filibuster’s future may have played into McConnell’s decision to yield on a short-term increase, as forcing senators such as Manchin and Sinema to choose between defending the filibuster and avoiding default <a href="https://twitter.com/LPDonovan/status/1445887228266307584" target="_blank" rel="noopener">could have generated</a> enough pressure to truly threaten the filibuster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, changes to the filibuster remain unlikely, and while there are other, <a href="https://www.axios.com/trillion-dollar-platinum-coin-mint-janet-yellen-223e7722-d7ba-47c9-b5f6-49a841d181de.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more outrageous ideas</a> for overcoming the debt ceiling, <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2014/07/20/333032601/kicking-the-can-down-the-road-a-habit-thats-hard-to-kick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s not at all a surprise</a> that Congress has opted to kick the can a few feet down the road with a short-term increase. Come December, Congress will be right back at this same juncture. But as long as the debt ceiling exists in its current form, Congress will keep having these fights over raising it -- even if doing so seems to align with <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/einstein-s-parable-of-quantum-insanity/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CInsanity%20is%20doing%20the%20same,usually%20attributed%20to%20Albert%20Einstein." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Einstein’s definition of insanity</a>. “As a good governance person, I would like them to procedurally blunt this thing, because I don't think that they have the votes to get rid of it,” said Blessing. “It's just, how do you crowbar that into the congressional calendar with everything else that they're handling, I think is the real question.”</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><b data-stringify-type="bold">UPDATE (Aug. 25, 2021, 11:35 a.m.): </b>When FiveThirtyEight published this video in July, longtime sex workers described their experiences with censorship across platforms in the past and told us it was only a matter of time before OnlyFans kicked them off the platform. On Aug. 19, OnlyFans announced that it would ban sexually explicit content. The company’s CEO <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639356/onlyfans-ceo-tim-stokely-sexually-explicit-content-ban-banks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">attributed the decision</a> to pressure from banking partners. On Aug. 25, however, OnlyFans announced it was reversing that decision after getting assurances from payment processors.</p>

<p>During the pandemic, many sex workers found themselves without support. Even sex workers &#8212; like strippers &#8212; whose jobs are legal were denied unemployment benefits and stimulus money. As a result, a number of in-person sex workers turned to online work. But online performers have struggled to get paid for years, long before the pandemic. As the industry changes and more performers move online, will the very platforms that sex workers made famous turn on them?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">In the last year and a quarter, the pandemic <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has served as a stark reminder</a> of just how unequal America still is. But it also hasn’t been a “reminder” for everyone. Black Americans and other Americans of color didn’t have the luxury of forgetting that American society is unequal. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Black Americans, in particular, the statistics around <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2775687" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the inequalities of COVID-19</a> are numerical stand-ins for a much larger issue that permeates so many aspects of life — everything from being <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/05/us/vaccine-racial-disparities.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">able to get a life-saving vaccine</a> to <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/34/16793" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the risk of being killed by police</a>.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reality is that our nation is still racially segregated. And it’s segregated in ways that limit our opportunities to learn about each other’s life experiences, even if our laws do not formally segregate our nation <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Color-Law-Forgotten-Government-Segregated/dp/1631492853" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as they once did</a>. This means that some live in a world in which they rarely encounter the conditions that bring harm to others everyday; others can’t escape those very conditions.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">You can see this segregation in great detail by exploring the University of Virginia’s <a href="http://racialdotmap.demographics.coopercenter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Racial Dot Map</a>, which takes data from the 2010 U.S. Census and plots where people are living across the country. For instance, take southeastern Michigan, where I lived as a graduate student. You can see clear geographic separation between predominantly Black, white, Asian and Hispanic neighborhoods.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="3360" height="1886" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.SCREENSHOT.png?w=700" alt="" class="wp-image-311333" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.SCREENSHOT.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.SCREENSHOT.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.SCREENSHOT.png?w=700" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.SCREENSHOT.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.SCREENSHOT.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This pattern is, of course, not unique to Michigan: It’s all over the country. And now as a professor, when I travel to other universities to give talks about my research on inequality, I often include the map for the location I am visiting to show the audience how this process manifests in their own city or town.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Why does this matter? The places where we live affect not only our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/covid-19-reminded-us-of-just-how-unequal-america-is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">access to resources</a>, but also who we <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-soc-073018-022707?journalCode=soc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">meet, interact with and become friends with</a>. And because our neighborhoods are so segregated, our social networks are also siloed — about<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> three-quarters of white Americans <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/08/25/three-quarters-of-whites-dont-have-any-non-white-friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t have any nonwhite friends</a>, according to a 2014 survey from PRRI. The nature of segregation in the U.S. means that we only end up seeing<em> </em>and learning about what our own groups experience, making it hard to understand the lives of people outside of our own group.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This explains, in part, why Americans have such a hard time understanding just <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/Norton_Michael_Building%20a%20better%20America%20One%20wealth%20quintile%20at%20a%20time_4c575dff-fe1d-4002-b61a-1227d08b71be.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">how unequal</a> our nation is, and moreover, the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418822335" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>racialized</em> nature of that inequality</a>. For example, if you ask Americans about racial wealth gaps, you’ll find that they severely underestimate those gaps; according to a 2019 paper from a team of psychologists, Americans think the Black-white wealth gap is <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1745691619863049" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40 to 80 percent smaller than it actually is</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1254" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.png" alt="" class="wp-image-311401" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lewis.RACIAL-INEQUALITY.0618.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">This data is consistent with the idea that Americans misperceive the state of racial progress in the nation — they see far more racial progress <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0735275118813614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than has actually taken place</a>. To be clear, our nation has surely made some progress toward racial equality since its founding. But that progress does not negate the <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/disparities-in-wealth-by-race-and-ethnicity-in-the-2019-survey-of-consumer-finances-20200928.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vast gaps that still exist between racial groups</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These kinds of misperceptions are consequential. Failing to understand the nature of racial inequality can make it <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-coming-up-with-effective-interventions-to-address-covid-19-is-so-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difficult to generate effective solutions</a> to the problems it causes. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We saw this play out with the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. When the data started showing <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/06/07/vaccine-equity-black-americans-biden-491973" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racial disparities in vaccination rates</a>, Americans blamed “<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2778073" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vaccine hesitancy</a>,” insinuating that the main reason Black Americans weren’t getting vaccinated as quickly as white Americans was due to Black Americans’ negative attitudes about vaccines or a <a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-03-25/current-medical-racism-not-tuskegee-expls-vaccine-hesitancy-among-black-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lingering distrust about the Tuskegee Syphilis Study</a>, in<a href="https://www.latimes.com/science/story/2021-03-25/current-medical-racism-not-tuskegee-expls-vaccine-hesitancy-among-black-americans" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> which researchers denied Black men treatment for syphilis so they could track the natural progression of the disease. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">As <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/opinion/us-covid-black-people.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Rhea Boyd noted</a>, however, a closer look at the data shows that when Black Americans are given the opportunity, they tend to get vaccinated, which means that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-fewer-black-americans-are-getting-the-covid-19-vaccine-no-its-not-hesitancy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">addressing the larger structural issues of access</a> can go far in reducing racial disparities in vaccination. Neglecting and then blaming marginalized communities for their misfortunes is not a new phenomenon, however. Black Americans were also neglected <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/06/pandemics-end-when-we-stop-caring-about-their-victims/619127/?utm_source=feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the smallpox epidemic of the 1860s</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past year, white Americans had an opportunity to learn more about these racial dynamics in our nation — dynamics that should have been covered in U.S. history classes, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/01/28/trumps-1776-report-is-getting-lot-criticism-its-how-most-us-history-is-already-being-taught/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but often aren’t</a>. It was an opportunity to learn more about the underlying conditions that continue to divide our nation, in order to <a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/564299/how-to-be-an-antiracist-by-ibram-x-kendi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take more action</a> to unite it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/jun/03/anti-racist-book-sales-surge-us-uk-george-floyd-killing-robin-diangelo-white-fragility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought books</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/us/racism-white-americans.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say they learned</a>. But there is a question of whether those lessons will stick. Although the police killing of George Floyd sparked massive, worldwide protests that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/12/us/george-floyd-white-protesters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many white people participated in</a>, just one year later, support for the Black Lives Matter movement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/22/opinion/blm-movement-protests-support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has already dissipated</a>; some white Americans are even <em>less</em> supportive of Black Lives Matter than they were prior to Floyd’s death.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Moreover, some of the companies that made commitments to racial equality in the past year have since engaged in behavior that contradicts what they pledged to do. For instance, six months after saying they stood <a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/standing-with-black-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with the Black community</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/technology/google-researcher-timnit-gebru.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google fired Timnit Gebru,</a> whom they had hired to make their artificial intelligence more ethical and inclusive and is one of the few Black women in her field.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Google, of course, is not alone in its contradictions. A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-17/blm-pledges-came-from-companies-with-fewer-black-employees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent study</a> of diversity in the technology industry found that companies that made statements of solidarity after the murder of George Floyd had 20 percent fewer Black employees, on average, than those that did not. In other words, at least some of the people and institutions who say that Black lives matter are doing so even when their own behaviors or <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122418822335" target="_blank" rel="noopener">organizational cultures reinforce racial inequality</a>.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When I first started studying these issues, I thought that we could just “train away” biases that perpetuate racial inequality. I’m not the only one who thought so; companies spend around <a href="https://time.com/5118035/diversity-training-infuriates-men-fails-women/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$8 billion per year on diversity training</a> programs trying to do just that. But that turns out to be <a href="https://behavioralpolicy.org/articles/developing-delivering-effective-anti-bias-training-challenges-recommendations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more challenging than it sounds</a>; interventions to change implicit biases, for instance, fade rapidly — according to one paper, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-29854-001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after about 24 hours</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To better understand why this happens and why so many people <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/04/05/gov-cuomo-is-wrong-covid-19-is-anything-an-equalizer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">still misunderstand disparate outcomes</a>, I reviewed and synthesized research from across the social sciences for an academic paper about why Americans misunderstand inequality, and what that means for efforts to address it. What I found, in short, is that the biases we have that lead us to see some things but not others, don’t exist in vacuums. They come from the same segregated and racialized neighborhoods and institutions that we go right back into when the diversity trainings are over. Our environments and institutions <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2017.1335568" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reinforce our biases</a>. So if our social structures <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2372732220983840" target="_blank" rel="noopener">don’t fundamentally change</a>, it’s difficult to <a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-psych-071620-030619" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change the people within them</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Our social structures make it really <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352250X17300465" target="_blank" rel="noopener">difficult to see the bigger, unequal picture</a> as individuals, and thus to reach consensus about both the nature of racial inequality as well as efforts to address it. The same group of psychologists I mentioned earlier actually tried to correct white Americans’ misperceptions about racial economic inequality in <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167220942625?journalCode=pspc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two recent studies</a>. What they found was that, ironically, reminding white Americans about racial disparities actually led them to view the past as <em>more </em>racially equitable than those who were not reminded; and the reminder of long-standing disparities did not change their misperceptions about the present — despite the researchers’ efforts, participants still believed that our nation had made more racial progress than it really had.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What can we do to close these racial gaps that are well-documented, but that <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/09/the-mythology-of-racial-progress/614173/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some Americans do not believe in</a>? In some ways, this issue is similar to climate change. Climate change is <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2016/10/04/the-politics-of-climate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a deeply political issue</a>, but its existence doesn’t depend on people believing in it — <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">there is plenty of evidence that it’s real</a>. The same is true of racial inequality in America: There is a mountain of evidence documenting its manifestation in <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/unequal-opportunity-race-and-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">education</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK425844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">health</a>, <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0963721418763931#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criminal justice</a>, <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/41/10870" target="_blank" rel="noopener">employment</a> and many other domains. And there are experts who have devoted their careers to studying how the <a href="https://thenewpress.com/books/cutting-school" target="_blank" rel="noopener">structure,</a> culture and <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/fragmented-democracy/9A69DF1567190EF38883D4766EBC0AAC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">politics</a> of American society (re)produce inequality, as well as pathways for disrupting those cycles. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Therefore, if we want to disrupt long-standing patterns of racial inequality, our best course of action as a country might be to rely on that <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Here-Equality-Reparations-Americans-Twenty-First/dp/1469654970" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence and expertise</a> instead of trying to convince people that the disparities exist, as it will always be hard for people to see inequality if it doesn’t bring harm to their own lives.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">President Biden will soon sign into law a <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2021/3/6/22315536/stimulus-package-passes-checks-unemployment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$1.9 trillion bill</a> intended to boost the economy and help the U.S. deal with the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic. It’s only the second bill <a href="https://prospect.org/first100/forgotten-bills-biden-can-get-through-by-majority-vote/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden has signed into law</a> and likely to be one of the most significant. So let’s look at what we learned from the process of enacting this legislation: </p>



<h2><strong>The Biden-led Democratic Party is more liberal and populist than the Obama or Clinton versions. </strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">In 2009, Barack Obama was in the White House and Democrats controlled both the U.S. House and Senate. The <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/a-guide-to-the-financial-crisis--10-years-later/2018/09/10/114b76ba-af10-11e8-a20b-5f4f84429666_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Great Recession</a> was still in full force, and one of the first things the party did was propose a stimulus bill. But many Democrats, particularly <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2009/02/01/news/economy/senators_nelson_collins_stimulus/index.htm?postversion=2009020114" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more moderate members of Congress</a>, were wary of being cast as supporting too much spending. So Democrats made sure the bill <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/100961/memo-larry-summers-obama" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cost less than $1 trillion</a>, eventually landing at <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=6899841&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a figure of $787 billion</a>. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/white-house-economists-thinking-covid-19-relief-fivethirtyeight-76157114</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">Twelve years later, Democrats passed a bill with about double the spending of the 2009 bill.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adjusting for inflation, $787 billion in 2009 is roughly equivalent to &lt;a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;$940 billion today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a> The economic challenges caused by COVID-19 are much different than those caused by the banking and housing-bubble crash of 2008, so it’s hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison and say whether the 2009 stimulus or this one is closer to the optimal range of spending to boost the economy. But in my view, the higher spending in the 2021 stimulus bill compared to 2009 isn’t just about the underlying economic conditions. Today’s Democratic Party is <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/11/28/democratic-party-has-moved-left-so-has-us-this-explains-how-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further to the left</a> than its 2009 version — in particular, it is more open to spending and much less worried about being cast as big-government liberals. So while this bill is about boosting the economy in the short term because of COVID-19, it also includes a number of <a href="https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1368263759748337664" target="_blank" rel="noopener">liberal policies</a> that Democrats probably would have tried to adopt even if there was no coronavirus-induced shutdown, such as increasing the child tax credit to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/04/new-3000-dollar-child-tax-credit-would-help-10-million-kids-in-poverty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$3,000 per school-aged child</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/03/health-202-buried-biden-stimulus-plan-is-29-percent-spending-hike-obamacare-subsidies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increasing subsidies</a> for people buying health insurance through the Affordable Care Act. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Indeed, the party’s left wing <a href="https://twitter.com/brianschatz/status/1368263759748337664?s=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is delighted</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ajentleson/status/1368288401921818625?s=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with this legislation</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This is spending at the scale of the problem,” said <a href="https://rooseveltinstitute.org/authors/mike-konczal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Konczal</a>, director of the progressive Roosevelt Institute. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">He added, “It wasn’t cut down by worries of doing too much, or performing moderation, or cynical debt fear. Remarkable.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">David Dayen of the left-leaning American Prospect <a href="https://prospect.org/first100/biden-rescue-plan-necessary-inequality-masks-economic-pain/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described the bill</a> as “a down payment on reversing 40 years of inequitable treatment for the middle class in America.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The American Rescue Plan is the most significant piece of legislation to benefit working people in the modern history of this country,” <a href="https://twitter.com/berniesanders/status/1368256311549435911?s=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said Sen. Bernie Sanders.</a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What has changed since 2009 to make Democrats more comfortable with this kind of bill? Most of all, the left wing of the party — think Sens. Sanders and Elizabeth Warren — has <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bidens-team-and-priorities-show-how-the-democratic-party-changed-in-the-trump-era/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">much more power and influence</a>, pulling more moderate figures like Biden to the left. Democrats also seem to have concluded that there is not much electoral risk to spending a lot or being portrayed as too eager to spend federal dollars. That’s probably because it’s not clear that Republicans suffered electorally because of the massive increase in the national debt <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/national-debt-trump" target="_blank" rel="noopener">during the Trump presidency</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats, and Biden specifically, also seem to have learned some lessons since those early days of the Obama presidency …  </p>



<h2><strong>To Biden, ‘unity’ does not necessarily mean bipartisanship</strong>. </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before his inauguration, Biden <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/14/politics/biden-economic-rescue-package-coronavirus-stimulus/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid out a $1.9 trillion proposal</a> for COVID-19 relief. I figured this was a negotiating tactic and that he would bring this figure down in part to win over Republican votes on Capitol Hill. He did not. Instead, Biden and his aides <a href="https://apnews.com/article/biden-618-billion-coronavirus-aid-a96acb5c835de5bffec28dbdbce5cd4e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">met with</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-donald-trump-brian-deese-coronavirus-pandemic-a153831e6e4a46393fffb1bb376ab70e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">congressional Republicans</a> and said the administration was open to striking a compromise with the GOP — but Biden never fundamentally changed his proposal. The Biden administration appeared to prioritize enacting its policy goals over trying to reach a deal that Democrats didn’t think Republicans were interested in anyway. (More on Republicans’ posture in a bit.) </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Biden’s approach suggests that the former vice president took the same lesson from the Obama years that political experts and <a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/02/03/democrats-covid-stimulus-obama-lessons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">other Democratic politicians</a> did: The GOP may be unwilling to reach deals with a Democratic president on major legislation, no matter its details. The Obama administration spent months in 2009 negotiating with congressional Republicans on the bill that is now known as Obamacare, even though it is now <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/2/4/22262467/democrats-covid-stimulus-reconciliation-biden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fairly clear that Republicans were never going to reach an agreement</a> and make one of Obama’s signature pieces of legislation bipartisan. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If their approach to the COVID-19 relief bill is any guide, it looks like Biden and his aides aren’t exactly abandoning the president’s unity rhetoric <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/interactive/2021/01/20/biden-inauguration-speech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from his inaugural speech</a> — they’re just not willing to sacrifice legislative goals in chase of it. Instead, the Biden team is pursuing unity by performing the <em>rituals</em> of bipartisanship — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/03/04/joe-biden-live-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">holding regular meetings</a> with congressional Republicans and being polite to them — and by pursuing legislation that is popular with a substantial number of Republicans <em>voters </em>(and continually <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/09/you-want-unity-bidens-got-unity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">emphasizing that point</a>). Polls, for example, showed <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/3/3/22310159/poll-coronavirus-relief-bipartisan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big chunk of</a> <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/03/03/coronavirus-stimulus-voter-support-bipartisan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican voters</a> <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_030321/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed</a> the stimulus proposal. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But will major Biden initiatives get passed with lots of Republican votes? That seems very, very unlikely at this point. Congressional Democrats are already discussing using the <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2021/02/05/what-is-reconciliation-in-congress/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reconciliation process</a> again — that’s how this stimulus package was enacted — <a href="https://www.axios.com/bernie-sanders-senate-infrastructure-bill-f4bfc3b8-530d-461b-9e23-416bee31e34a.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to pass an infrastructure bill</a>. By using reconciliation, Democrats can bypass the Senate filibuster and pass legislation without any GOP votes. </p>



<h2><strong>Democrats have a big filibuster problem</strong>. </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats like Sanders were desperate to include a minimum wage increase in the COVID-19 relief bill because it may be one of the few major laws enacted this year — at least as long as the filibuster remains in place. But the Senate’s parliamentarian said that a $15 federal minimum wage <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/25/970637190/senate-cant-vote-on-15-minimum-wage-parliamentarian-rules" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would violate the budgetary rules</a> that govern what can be included in reconciliation bills. So Democrats dropped it from the legislation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As long as a 60-vote threshold remains in place, it is likely that a $15 minimum wage is not the only major part of the Democratic agenda that will go nowhere. Bills to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/03/politics/house-democrats-hr1-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reform the election system,</a> limit discrimination <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/969591569/house-to-vote-on-equality-act-heres-what-the-law-would-do" target="_blank" rel="noopener">against Americans</a> on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/03/973111306/house-approves-police-reform-bill-named-after-george-floyd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">change policing practices</a> that were passed recently in the House also seem dead on arrival in the Senate because of the filibuster. </p>



<h2><strong>Democrats also have a big Manchin-Sinema problem</strong>. </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is true most of all with regards to the filibuster, of course. Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona are the most vocal Democrats <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/25/joe-manchin-filibuster-462364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opposed to getting rid of the filibuster</a>. And because Democrats control only 50 Senate seats,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes two independents who caucus with the Democrats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a> the filibuster will remain in place as long as any Democrat (and all Republicans) wish it so. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at least based on this stimulus process, Democrats may have a Manchin-Sinema problem, even putting the filibuster aside. Getting the vote of the senator from West Virginia, in particular, will continue to be hard. Biden may get the house, plane and oval-shaped office, but there’s a chance his years in office are most defined by what Manchin wants (and doesn’t want). </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/democrats-covid-relief-bill-popular-gop-vote-76055259</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">On this stimulus bill, Manchin — along with a few more conservative Democrats — forced the party to limit cash payments to individuals <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/03/03/biden-limits-eligibility-stimulus-payments-under-pressure-moderate-senate-democrats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">making less than $80,000 per year</a>, while the bill had originally allowed people making up to $100,000 to get at least some money. Manchin also <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/05/us/politics/senate-stimulus-bill.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successfully pushed to lower enhanced unemployment benefits</a> in the bill from $400 to $300 per week. And while this bill was making its way through Congress, Manchin <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/02/19/manchin-oppose-neera-tanden-omb-470296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his opposition</a> to Neera Tanden, Biden’s then-nominee to run the Office of Management and Budget, effectively <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/tanden-withdraws-as-budget-nominee-in-bidens-first-cabinet-defeat/2021/03/02/7d596028-7bb0-11eb-b3d1-9e5aa3d5220c_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">killing her nomination</a>. The senator is already hinting that <a href="https://twitter.com/mkraju/status/1368730192341000196?s=11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">he is wary of backing an infrastructure bill</a> if it doesn’t have some GOP support. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All that said, Manchin, who represents a state that <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-west-virginia.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden lost by 39 percentage points in 2020</a>, did just back a $1.9 trillion bill. So let’s not overstate his resistance to his party’s main goals. </p>



<h2><strong>Republicans are using their Obama-era playbook</strong>. </h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Democrats all but guaranteed strong GOP opposition to this bill by sticking to its $1.9 trillion price tag and including non-COVID-19-related priorities in it. At the same time, it is not clear that any but a few Republicans would have ever voted for a Biden stimulus. The votes over <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/republicans-impeaching-donald-trump.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump’s impeachment</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/trump-impeachment-trial-live-updates/2021/02/15/967878039/7-gop-senators-voted-to-convict-trump-only-1-faces-voters-next-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and removal</a> and controversies over <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/03/politics/liz-cheney-house-republican-meeting/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reps.

So GOP congressional leaders wanted <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/mcconnell-fight-stimulus-bill-every-way-biden-urges-senate-dems-get-it-done-now-1573304" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the party to unite</a> in opposing <a href="https://spectrumlocalnews.com/nc/charlotte/news/2021/02/27/gop-tests-history-in-vote-against-pandemic-relief" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biden’s stimulus bill</a>. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And even without a desire to get past the intra-party friction over Trump, Republicans might have <em>still </em>mobilized against this bill. All indications are that Republicans think that the way to win back control of the House and/or Senate next year is to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-republicans-dont-fear-an-electoral-backlash-for-opposing-really-popular-parts-of-bidens-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repeat their strategy from the Obama years</a>: intense and total opposition to the agenda of the sitting Democratic president. </p>



<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Those are my main takeaways from the COVID-19 relief bill. None are exactly surprising, but this process has clarified how Biden is approaching his presidency. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">During the 2020 campaign and after his victory, Biden had <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/does-biden-really-think-republicans-will-work-with-him-and-could-he-be-right/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested that some Republicans could be persuaded to back his agenda</a> because of his persona and long tenure on Capitol Hill. Those comments were (and are) probably politically and electorally smart, because most voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/01/15/biden-begins-presidency-with-positive-ratings-trump-departs-with-lowest-ever-job-mark/?utm_source=AdaptiveMailer&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=21-01-15%20Biden%20and%20Capitol%20Riot%20GEN%20DIST&amp;org=982&amp;lvl=100&amp;ite=7758&amp;lea=1704716&amp;ctr=0&amp;par=1&amp;trk=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">want the parties to work together</a>, and most lawmakers are going to view a president more favorably if he at least gives the veneer of wanting to work with them. But it looks like that rhetoric was just that: a veneer. I mean, maybe Biden actually thought he could win some Republican votes, and the COVID-19 relief bill has showed him how hard-to-impossible that will be. But, more likely, Biden’s talk of working with Republicans was politically expedient spin all along. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">When things got real, Biden pushed a bill through with only Democratic votes, didn’t make major changes to placate Republicans and defined bipartisanship in a way that <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/10/politics/covid-relief-bill-house-vote/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn’t include getting <em>any</em> support</a> from <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/senate-passes-1-9-trillion-covid-relief-bill-including-1-n1259795" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican members of Congress</a>. Biden can’t change the underlying partisan dynamics in Washington, and it looks like he is quite aware of that, no matter what he told voters on the campaign trail. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Congressional Democrats are <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/us/the-house-voted-to-advance-2000-stimulus-checks-demanded-by-trump.html">pushing to give most Americans $2,000</a> stimulus checks, arguing that this is a fast and direct way to help millions of Americans as they struggle with the economic slowdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their actual proposal would in effect give most Americans an additional $1,400, since $600 payments were already enacted this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> President Trump <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/stimulus-checks-republicans/2020/12/30/cd5c79bc-4a0e-11eb-a9d9-1e3ec4a928b9_story.html">supports $2,000 payments</a>, too, but most <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/12/28/house-stimulus-checks/">congressional Republicans don’t</a>. Because of that congressional GOP opposition, the $2,000 checks aren’t likely to become law. But Democrats think they have a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/democrats-seize-on-mcconnells-stimulus-block-during-georgia-runoff">winning issue electorally</a> ahead of next week’s U.S. Senate runoffs in Georgia.</p>
<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/pollsters-sitting-georgia-runoffs-74939804</p>
<p>Public opinion does appear to be on Democrats’ side. Seventy-eight percent of Americans said they supported these $2,000 stimulus checks, compared to 17 percent who opposed them, according to a poll conducted Dec. 22-28 by the left-leaning <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2020/12/28/78-of-likely-voters-support-2000-relief-checks">Data for Progress</a>. Similarly, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/insider-poll-majority-stimulus-check-too-small-2020-12">a survey conducted by Business Insider and Survey Monkey</a> on Dec. 21 found that 62 percent of Americans said that the $600 stimulus checks adopted in a recent bill is not enough; 76 percent said the payments should be more than $1,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-split-verdict-in-georgia-isnt-that-crazy/?cid=_inlinerelated"><em><strong>[Why A Split Verdict In Georgia Isn’t That Crazy]</strong></em></a></p>
<p>So Democrats are pushing the issue hard. Georgia Senate candidates Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock have <a href="https://www.newsweek.com/georgia-senate-runoff-dems-attack-gop-incumbents-opposing-2000-stimulus-checks-1557617">strongly embraced the $2,000 payment plan</a>. Their Republican opponents, Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, are also <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/29/loeffler-trump-stimulus-payments-451860">suggesting that they support the payments</a>. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/29/951208033/mcconnell-blocks-senate-vote-on-2-000-direct-payments">creating procedural roadblocks to stop the $2,000 payments</a> from passing the Senate, giving <a href="https://twitter.com/ossoff/status/1344278173341667330">Ossoff</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ReverendWarnock/status/1344032992256274438">Warnock</a> the opportunity to suggest that Loeffler and Perdue are impediments to the payments, since they back McConnell continuing as majority leader.</p>
<p>So this all seems good for the Democrats, right? Well, maybe. Democrats are pushing a popular idea right before what <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-a-split-verdict-in-georgia-isnt-that-crazy/">look like very-close elections</a>, and the Republican Party is blocking it. The issue could well help Warnock and Ossoff in Georgia next week. But we shouldn’t be so sure, for a few reasons …</p>
<p>First, <b>it’s not clear that voters care that much about policy when deciding who to vote for.</b></p>
<p>The most reliable predictor of how Americans will vote is partisanship: Republican-leaning voters back Republican candidates, and Democratic-leaning voters back Democratic candidates. Those partisan labels and identities, of course, contain ideological and policy overtones: The Republican Party, rhetorically at least, is warier of big, broad-based spending programs than the Democratic Party. But those overtones don’t seem to drive vote choice. There are plenty of examples of a party pushing unpopular ideas without its voters switching to the other party. For instance, the GOP agenda in 2017 and 2018, trying to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-health-care-bill-is-unpopular-even-in-republican-districts/">repeal Obamacare</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-gop-tax-cuts-are-even-more-unpopular-than-past-tax-hikes/">cut taxes for corporations</a>, was fairly unpopular with Republican voters, but those voters <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2018/exit-polls">still overwhelmingly backed GOP candidates in the 2018 midterms</a>.</p>
<p>The Data for Progress polling suggests that 73 percent of Republicans nationally support the $2,000 payments, including 52 percent who strongly support them. Based on those numbers, it’s almost certainly the case that a majority of Republicans in Georgia support the payments. Indeed, a <a href="https://filesforprogress.org/memos/georgia-voters-support-progressive-issues.pdf">DFP poll of Georgia likely voters</a> conducted Nov. 15-20 found that 63 percent of voters in the state said that they would be more likely to support a candidate who favored a $1,200 payment to most Americans as part of a COVID-19 relief package. That 63 percent number also suggests these payments are broadly popular and getting some backing from rank-and-file GOP voters.</p>
<p>But it’s very unlikely that many Republicans will back the Democratic candidates in Georgia because of this issue. Yes, both elections appear to be close, so even a small shift in voting preferences matters. But in such a close election, if either Ossoff and Warnock narrowly win, I would be hesitant to ascribe that victory to Democrats’ support of this stimulus payment and McConnell’s opposition, as opposed to factors like <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/12/30/georgia-senate-early-voting-452221">Democrats’ strong get-out-the-vote operations in the state</a>, the weaknesses of Loeffler and Perdue as candidates and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-georgia-turned-blue/">the growing liberalism of Georgia.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/why-georgia-isnt-like-the-other-battleground-states/?cid=_inlinerelated"><em><strong>[Related: Why Georgia Isn’t Like The Other Battleground States]</strong></em></a></p>
<p>What about swing voters/independents and other people who aren’t necessarily tied to one of the two parties? Well, the evidence suggests that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-moderate-middle-is-a-myth/">these kinds of voters don’t necessarily have well-defined policy preferences</a> and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/09/how-swing-voters-are-thinking-about-the-2020-election.html">also don’t pay that much attention to politics</a>. So perhaps this stimulus debate convinces them that Republicans in Washington need to be dethroned. Alternatively, perhaps these voters aren’t as tuned into this stimulus debate as much as, say, Loeffler’s ads <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/26/politics/fact-check-georgia-senate-warnock-ossoff/index.html">casting Warnock as a radical</a> or Warnock’s ads <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/raphael-warnocks-dog-ads-cut-against-white-voters-stereotypes-of-black-people/">portraying himself as a nice dog owner</a>.</p>
<p>Second, <b>voters may like Democratic economic ideas more than Democrats themselves.</b></p>
<p>Over the last several years, ballot initiatives to <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Minimum_wage_on_the_ballot">increase the minimum wage</a> and to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/upshot/missouri-election-medicaid-expansion.html">expand Medicaid</a> have passed in conservative-leaning states where GOP state legislators and governors had blocked similar policies. But Republicans are still winning elections in these areas. This happened in Florida this year. A proposal to gradually increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2026 passed in the Sunshine State, with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/03/us/elections/results-florida.html">61 percent of voters</a> embracing it. But Joe Biden, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/10/23/debate-minimum-wage-increase/">who strongly supports a $15 minimum wage</a>, won only 48 percent of the vote in Florida, compared to 51 percent for Trump, who has been more circumspect about minimum wage increases.</p>
<p>These voting patterns are another illustration that partisanship overrides &#8212; or is simply independent from &#8212; voters’ policy preferences, but there are other potential reasons for this disconnect. Voters may support certain economically populist ideas but may be wary of too much economic populism if they elect a Democratic candidate. Some voters may support Democrats’ economic populism but not back the party because it is too progressive on issues like abortion rights or policing. For example, in the 2016 election, Lee Drutman, a scholar at New America and a FiveThirtyEight contributor, found that voters who lean conservative on issues like immigration but who lean left on economic issues were <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/political-divisions-in-2016-and-beyond">more likely to back Trump</a> than Hillary Clinton. And lastly, many voters <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/23/ahead-of-debates-many-voters-dont-know-much-about-where-trump-clinton-stand-on-major-issues/">are simply not attuned</a> to which party or candidate favors which policies.</p>
<p>When you bring this to Georgia, you could easily imagine some swing voters who support $2,000 payments to Americans but are even more supportive of backing the GOP Senate candidates and ensuring that Democrats in Washington don’t have control of the White House <i>and</i> both chambers of Congress.</p>
<p>Finally, <b>Trump has scrambled the politics on stimulus checks.</b></p>
<p>You could also imagine some voters are just confused about this issue. If Trump strongly supports the $2,000 checks and Loeffler and Perdue are indicating support for them, too, it might not be totally clear to voters that the broader Republican Party still opposes the payments and is the roadblock to them being approved. Particularly in this lame-duck period for Trump, McConnell is the most important Republican in Washington in terms of policy. But Trump remains the defining figure for the party to most voters and in an electoral context. If Trump is declaring he supports the $2,000 payments, voters in Georgia might conclude that Republicans more broadly support them, even as McConnell is blocking the payments and Loeffler and Perdue are effectively helping him do so, as is the case here.</p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-the-early-vote-in-georgia-can-and-cant-tell-us/?cid=_inlinerelated"><em><strong>[What The Early Vote In Georgia Can — And Can’t — Tell Us]</strong></em></a></p>
<p>All that said, this debate about the direct payments coinciding with the Georgia election has shown how electoral politics and governance intersect in interesting ways. While it is not clear if the debate over the stimulus payments will affect the election results, it <i>is</i> clear that the upcoming election has affected the stimulus debate. Republicans were reportedly worried about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/16/business/us-economy-coronavirus">opposing direct payments on the eve of the Georgia race</a>, helping ensure that $600 for most Americans was <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/12/27/politics/trump-relief-bill-christmas-eve/index.html">put into the COVID-19 economic stimulus that Trump signed into law on Sunday</a>. Republicans are now worried about a potential electoral backlash in Georgia from opposing the $2,000 payments. Those electoral concerns have resulted in Loeffler and Perdue, who usually take more conservative stands, breaking with McConnell and other Republicans to publicly support the payments. (Of course, Loeffler and Perdue are likely to go along with McConnell’s strategies to make sure the $2,000 payments don’t become law.)</p>
<p>So Democrats may have figured out how to get more populist policies adopted: Push them around election time. But even if Ossoff and Warnock win next week, the evidence that popular economic policies are automatically electoral boosts for Democrats will be somewhat weak.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.nber.org/cycles/june2020.html">It’s been about four months</a> since the National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the U.S. was officially in a recession, and what a weird recession — and recovery — it’s been. The stock market has been <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economy-is-a-mess-so-why-isnt-the-stock-market/">merrily chugging along</a> since February, when the recession began; <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economy-was-trumps-one-remaining-advantage-now-he-might-have-blown-it/">disposable income increased</a> even though millions of Americans were out of work; and unemployment has been bouncing back much <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/wsj-survey-overall-economy-is-recovering-faster-than-economists-expected-11599746400">faster than economists expected</a>.</p>
<p>But there’s still a lot of uncertainty about what will happen as winter approaches and COVID-19 <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/10/13/coronavirus-cases-rising/?itid=lk_inline_manual_5">cases start to tick up again</a>. And many economists are still not very optimistic about the speed of our trajectory back to a pre-pandemic economy — even though some signals might be improving.</p>
<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/americans-covid-19-test-fivethirtyeight-72652386</p>
<p><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/dont-expect-a-quick-recovery-our-survey-of-economists-says-it-will-likely-take-years/">In May</a>, FiveThirtyEight kicked off a biweekly survey of 30-odd quantitative macroeconomists in partnership with the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. We asked the economists to forecast the trajectory of various economic indicators. And after 10 rounds of questions, it’s clear that on some metrics — particularly unemployment — the economists have become a lot more bullish about the speed of the recovery. Yet that optimism hasn’t translated into greater confidence that we’ll be back to economic normalcy anytime soon. <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Results-Round-10.pdf">In the latest round of the survey</a>, conducted from Oct. 9 to 12, the economists collectively thought there was a 66 percent probability that the economy won’t truly be back to normal until 2022 or later.</p>
<p>“We generally think of the recession as something of a ‘swoosh’ shape, and we are now on the slow part of the rebound,” said <a href="https://econ.jhu.edu/directory/jonathan-wright/">Jonathan Wright</a>, an economics professor at Johns Hopkins University who has been consulting with FiveThirtyEight on the design of the survey. “It was always easier to say that the recovery will be a slow grind than to know the near-term trajectory. So it makes sense that while economists got much more optimistic about the near-term, they largely kept their view that the damage will take a long time to repair.”</p>
<p>We looked at a handful of questions that we asked in nearly every round of the survey to see how things changed between the late spring and now. On one question — about the state of unemployment in December 2020 — the economists got markedly more optimistic. The average point estimate for December unemployment fell from 12.8 percent in late May to 7.4 percent in the current round.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_288554" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-288554" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-4.png" alt="" width="575" height="585" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-4.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-4.png?w=1150 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-4.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-4.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-4.png?w=1150 2x"></figure></p>
<p>A big source of the optimism, of course, is that workers have been returning to their jobs over the past few months much faster than economists initially expected. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/septembers-jobs-report-is-a-political-rorschach-test/">The unemployment rate in September was 7.9 percent</a> — down from <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-terrible-jobs-report-gets-worse-the-more-you-read-it/">14.7 percent in April</a>. So in a sense, the current 7.4 percent prediction for December is actually pretty pessimistic — because it implies that, on average, the economists think there’s a good chance the unemployment rate will fall less than a percentage point over the next three months.</p>
<p>When it comes to fourth-quarter gross domestic product, meanwhile, the economists’ predictions were basically back where they started. In early June, the economists forecast 4.2 percent GDP growth in the survey, with a relatively wide confidence interval. In the last round, that forecast had improved only slightly, to 4.9 percent, and the confidence interval was just as wide — signaling that they hadn’t gotten any more sure about the outcome over the intervening months, either.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_288553" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-288553" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-3.png" alt="" width="575" height="550" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-3.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-3.png?w=1150 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-3.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/ATD.ECONOMIST-SURVEY.10XX-3.png?w=1150 2x"></figure></p>
<p>Of course, it’s worth noting that their forecasts for third-quarter GDP got significantly sunnier over the course of the summer, which might be part of the reason they weren’t expecting more quarter-over-quarter growth between the last two quarters of the year. But note how unsure economists still are about our economic situation at the end of the year. <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/timmermann/">Allan Timmermann</a>, a professor of economics at the University of California at San Diego who has also been consulting with FiveThirtyEight on the survey, said it’s “truly extraordinary” that the economists’ average band of uncertainty around their point estimate is essentially unchanged since June. “Normally, uncertainty would have been significantly reduced over such a long horizon,” he said.</p>
<p>Timmermann chalked up the uncertainty to the fact that so much remains unknown about how the pandemic will evolve. “Uncertainty about the trajectory of the virus and its impact on service sectors such as hospitality, travel, entertainment, eating out, remains in the forefront and has not really been resolved at this point,” he said. “Many firms are hoping to outlast the virus, but even at this point it is very unclear how long the pandemic will last.”</p>
<p>And that is perhaps why economists’ long-term estimates remain almost as dour as they were when the survey began. In every round, we asked them when GDP would return to pre-pandemic levels. Early on, the economists thought that there was a 67 percent chance that we wouldn’t be back to that point until the first half of 2022 at the earliest. In the last round, that outlook was basically unchanged.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The final jobs report before the presidential election <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm">is here</a>. In September, 661,000 more people were employed than in August, and the unemployment rate fell to 7.9 percent. That’s a slight — but not huge — improvement <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-easy-part-of-the-economic-recovery-might-be-over/">over last month</a>, when the unemployment rate was 8.4 percent. (Compare this report’s 0.5-percentage-point decrease to the 1.8-point drop between July and August.)</p>
<p>So heading into the fall, employment is in a better position than it was in the spring and summer, but the recovery is also plainly slowing down. With less than five weeks to go before the election, how much will that affect President Trump or former Vice President Joe Biden’s chances?</p>
<p>Even in a normal year, our election analysis would be <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/obamas-magic-number-150000-jobs-per-month/">looking at the jobs report</a> as <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/measuring-the-effect-of-the-economy-on-elections/">just one economic indicator among many</a>. But this year is even weirder than usual because there’s kind of a Rorschach test element to the report — people of different political leanings can see what they want to see.</p>
<p>Historically, jobs reports released shortly before the election have been reasonable bellwethers for how the incumbent party will do, although the last jobs report of the cycle isn’t necessarily the most reliable. In the 18 presidential elections since 1948,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE"&gt;earliest year&lt;/a&gt; for which we have seasonally adjusted data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a> the unemployment rate in the September before an election has had <a href="https://www.bmj.com/about-bmj/resources-readers/publications/statistics-square-one/11-correlation-and-regression">little correlation</a> with the incumbent party’s eventual popular vote margin. But when you frame that September number relative to earlier months — particularly the previous six to 12 months — it has traditionally been a much stronger predictor of electoral success for the incumbent party. (Though if you look at unemployment too far outside that window, the correlation dissipates.)</p>
<p>This suggests that voters care most about how unemployment is trending in the six months to a year leading up to the election and will give the incumbent party credit — or blame — for that trend.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_286624" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-286624" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-2.png" alt="" width="575" height="498" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-2.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-2.png?w=1150 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-2.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-2.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-2.png?w=1150 2x"></figure></p>
<p>This is all well and good under normal circumstances. But 2020, of course, is about as far from normal as it gets. And what the current economy means for Trump is very unclear. The unemployment situation, in an absolute sense, looks bad for an incumbent; a 7.9 percent September unemployment rate is the highest heading into any election since at least 1948. (It was 7.8 percent in September 2012.) But it could be much worse — things have been steadily improving over the past few months, with September’s unemployment rate coming in 6.8 percentage points lower than <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-terrible-jobs-report-gets-worse-the-more-you-read-it/">in April</a>. So even though the numbers might be awful if you look at them in a vacuum, the fact that unemployment is trending in the right direction could be read as good news for Trump.</p>
<p>These varying interpretations are perhaps why Americans of different political stripes have wildly different views of the economy. <a href="https://civiqs.com/results/economy_us_now?uncertainty=true&amp;annotations=true&amp;zoomIn=true">According to polling by Civiqs</a>, for a fleeting moment early in the pandemic, there wasn’t <i>such</i> a big gap between Republicans and Democrats in terms of how they saw the economy. But the gulf has widened considerably since then. A poll conducted at the end of September found that 80 percent of Republicans thought the economy was in at least fairly good shape, compared to only 8 percent of Democrats.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_286618" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-286618" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-3.png" alt="" width="575" height="494" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-3.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-3.png?w=1150 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-3.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-3.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002-3.png?w=1150 2x"></figure></p>
<p>That dissonance might be related to those two distinct ways of looking at the employment situation right now: Do you focus on the absolute level of unemployment? Or do you hold tight to the trend of the past few months? Depending on which lens you choose, you’re looking at a completely different economy. If you look only at the past three or four jobs reports, the country appears to be making steady progress toward economic recovery. If you look at the change over the past year, unemployment still appears catastrophically high.</p>
<p><figure id="attachment_286617" class="wp-caption aligncenter" style=""><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-286617" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002.png" alt="" width="575" height="475" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002.png?w=1150 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002.png?w=575 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/atdPaineWolfe.JOBS_.1002.png?w=1150 2x"></figure></p>
<p>The trouble is that neither of these statements is wrong, exactly — it is true that workers are coming back on the job <a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-biggest-payroll-surprise-in-history-economists-react-to-may-jobs-report-2020-06-05">much more quickly than economists initially predicted</a>, <i>and</i> it’s true that tens of millions of Americans are still out of work. But together, it doesn’t make for a very clean political message — which is why Republicans and Democrats can each look at this jobs report and see good news for their candidate and bad news for their opponent.</p>
<p>“Republicans are looking at the changes month-to-month and saying, “We’re creating millions of jobs every month; we’re getting the economy back on track,’” said Andrew Chamberlain, chief economist at the job search site Glassdoor. “And you have people on the left saying: ‘There are still millions of Americans out of work and we had Depression-level changes in employment in April, May and June.’” Partisanship being a helluva drug, there are ample opportunities for both sides to spin this most recent jobs report in whatever direction benefits them most, potentially rendering any historical comparisons irrelevant.</p>
<p>Making things even more difficult to interpret, unemployment is just one of many factors that would be considered when assessing the country’s economic situation heading into the election.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2020-election-forecast/">our election forecast model</a>, payroll jobs <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-fivethirtyeights-2020-presidential-forecast-works-and-whats-different-because-of-covid-19">are included</a> as part of the economic picture that contributes to the overall prediction. But we also incorporate a number of other economic indicators, and right now, some of those indicators are moving in opposite directions.</p>
<p>That’s because this is a <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/10/economy/recession-history/index.html">really weird recession</a>: Millions of people are out of work, but <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PSAVERT">savings</a> and <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DSPIC96">income</a> remained elevated for months, at least in part because of the federal supplement to people’s unemployment checks. Now that’s gone, but <a href="https://tracktherecovery.org/?8ilna">spending is still up a lot</a> even though income has fallen a bit. And <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economy-is-a-mess-so-why-isnt-the-stock-market/">don’t even talk to us about the stock market</a>, which rallied this summer despite the other economic turmoil.</p>
<p>So from the perspective of the election model, the economic situation has improved since June and we’re basically at an average economy — even though jobs are <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE">still quite bad</a> in a historical sense.</p>
<p>The last wrinkle is that the picture could still change between now and Election Day, according to Nick Bunker, the director of economic research for North America at the Indeed Hiring Lab, a research institute connected to the job-search site Indeed. This year, the October jobs report will be released three days <i>after</i> the election. (To be clear: the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency that produces the jobs report, <a href="https://www.bls.gov/schedule/news_release/empsit.htm">did not do this on purpose</a>.) “In a normal year, you wouldn’t expect the economy to change all that dramatically over the span of a month and a half,” Bunker said. But over the next five weeks, anything is possible. And given that some voters <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/29/politics/ballot-returns-early-voting-2020-election/index.html">are already casting ballots</a>, any changes in October would mean that Americans who vote early could be making their choice for president in a fairly different economic reality than those who vote on Nov. 3.</p>
<p>All of this means that it’s not clear if the jobs report will help — or hurt — either candidate. In the end, it might just be a wash. After all, <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/trump-biden-debate-poll/">very few voters are undecided</a>. And this report might, more than anything else, just be a reminder of why it’s possible for Republicans and Democrats to see the economy in totally different ways.</p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Back in the early days of the coronavirus in the U.S., <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/policy-for-the-covid-19-crisis/">many economists believed</a> that aggressive lockdowns would be the best long-term solution for managing the pandemic, despite the short-term economic pain they would cause. Six months later, we wanted to know: Did that logic hold up? And what political events could still be in store to alter the course of the country’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-easy-part-of-the-economic-recovery-might-be-over/">ongoing recovery</a> from the current recession?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Results-Round-09.pdf">this week’s installment</a> of our <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/economist-survey/">economic survey</a>, conducted in partnership with the <a href="http://www.igmchicago.org/">Initiative on Global Markets</a> at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, FiveThirtyEight polled 32 quantitative macroeconomists about the present and future of the economy. And because we couldn’t resist some Monday-morning quarterbacking, we also asked whether the lockdowns earlier in the year were too aggressive or not aggressive enough.</p>
<p>Out of those surveyed, 74 percent of economists said the U.S. would be in a better economic position now if lockdowns had been more aggressive at the beginning of the crisis. Among that camp, the most commonly cited reason was that early control over the virus would have allowed a smoother and more comprehensive return to economic activity later on. “More aggressive lockdowns would have [gotten] the country in a better position (health wise) as we head into fall and winter,” said <a href="http://public.econ.duke.edu/~ap172/">Andrew Patton</a>, a professor of economics and finance at Duke University.</p>
<p>“It would also have signaled more clearly to the whole country that we need to take the virus seriously, and work together to get it under control,” Patton said. He paraphrased a quote from Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health, in a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/opinion/coronavirus-fall-winter.html">recent New York Times piece</a>: &#8220;There&#8217;s no peeing section in the pool,&#8221; meaning you can’t just have some areas locked down while others see looser restrictions &#8212; and greater viral spread.</p>
<p>Proponents of tighter lockdowns pointed to Japan and various European countries (such as Germany, Norway and Denmark) as examples of how reducing the virus to extremely low levels early on allowed for a quicker recovery. Others noted that children could have returned to school for in-person learning faster with earlier control over the virus &#8212; a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-pandemic-could-force-a-generation-of-mothers-out-of-the-workforce/">major consideration</a> in maximizing the country’s economic power as it bounces back from the pandemic.</p>
<p>Among the 26 percent who thought lockdowns should have been <i>less</i> aggressive, the main theme was that more good could have been done with a targeted approach that protected at-risk populations and stopped potential superspreading events, while allowing more activity overall. Others thought the lockdowns didn’t even matter much, or that most of the reduced activity was due to individual self-regulation rather than government intervention.</p>
<p>“I think the positive effect of more commerce on employment probably would have outweighed the higher infection rates in most places,” said <a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/deborah-j-lucas">Deborah Lucas</a>, a professor of finance at the MIT Sloan School of Management. “I also think the shutdowns were not very effective.”</p>
<p>“I think [a more aggressive lockdown] would barely make any difference since a large part of the population imposed mobility restrictions on themselves out of precautionary motives,” said <a href="https://economics.nd.edu/faculty/christiane-baumeister/">Christiane Baumeister</a>, professor of economics at the University of Notre Dame. Baumeister said she chose the less aggressive option in the survey because self-regulation “is not something that can actually be controlled by the authorities.”</p>
<p>In the same vein &#8212; but this time, looking <i>forward</i> &#8212; we asked the economists to imagine a new shutdown had to occur as the result of a spike in COVID-19 cases. Which activities would they shut down first if they also wanted to minimize economic damage? With the caveat that our panel consists of economic experts &#8212; not epidemiologists &#8212; they clearly prioritized indoor dining (and to a lesser extent, gyms) to be the first shut down, while outdoor dining and recreation were at the bottom of the list:</p>

<p>Interestingly, most economists did not especially prioritize shutting down schools. Universities and K-12 schools each received one first-priority vote apiece (out of 30 respondents who answered the question), and neither cracked the top four activities to be shut down first. Day care centers were even lower in the shutdown priority order. This does not mean that our panel thought reopening schools was necessarily safer, but it does underscore how much the panel thinks schools &#8212; and child care in general &#8212; help power the economy, and that shutting them down could have a deleterious economic effect.</p>
<p>In terms of future policy effects, we also included a longer-term version of a question <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-with-a-vaccine-the-economy-could-take-many-months-to-return-to-normal/">we posed to the panel about a month ago</a>: Which developments in the world of COVID-19 or the political world would cause economists’ GDP growth predictions to change for the better (or worse)? Again, schools are a big economic engine.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be said that causation goes in the opposite direction as well &amp;#8212; a scenario in which in-person learning is more possible also implies less viral spread, which would be correlated with better overall economic health.&lt;/p&gt;

<p>The results also bring into focus how the economists are viewing the election results and overall political climate. We’ve <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/economists-think-congress-should-keep-paying-unemployed-workers-600-a-week-or-even-more/">written many times</a> that they believe an infusion of additional money from Congress &#8212; whether in the form of enhanced federal unemployment insurance or another series of stimulus payments &#8212; is paramount to stabilize the economy through the recovery. According to our survey results, the biggest economic risk for 2021 is the possibility that no additional stimulus is passed by November 2020. And the economists see Democrats’ control of Congress as having a significant effect on growth potential in 2021, likely because they have been much more willing to pass government spending bills. (Note that even if Joe Biden wins the presidency but the Senate doesn’t flip to the Democrats, 94 percent of our panelists said their outlook for 2021 would remain essentially the same as it is now.)</p>
<p>“I think that failing to pass fiscal stimulus is the biggest downside risk,” said <a href="https://econ.jhu.edu/directory/jonathan-wright/">Jonathan Wright</a>, an economist at Johns Hopkins University who has been consulting with FiveThirtyEight on the survey. “And that’s probably made more likely by the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/18/politics/congress-fight-rgb-seat/index.html">RBG fight</a>.”</p>
<p>And of course, the possibility of rapid vaccine development is the single highest-upside scenario in the results above, while a situation where the election is viewed as illegitimate &#8212; a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-planning-for-an-election-day-that-could-last-months/">real possibility</a> &#8212; was another of the worst-case scenarios, according to the panel.</p>
<p>Yet no matter what happens, we can probably expect the stock market to pull through with minimal damage. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-economy-is-a-mess-so-why-isnt-the-stock-market/">As I wrote about in June</a>, the markets have not reflected the recession at large, with the S&amp;P 500 <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/chart/#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--">recovering practically all of its losses</a> since late February (even after a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/21/sp-500-paces-for-worst-september-since-2011-what-to-watch-now.html">shaky start to September</a>).

<p>Although some credence was given to the notion that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/27/big-tech-coronavirus-winners/">surging tech companies</a> were keeping the market afloat, economists clearly think the Federal Reserve bears the single-most responsibility for the stock market’s rally. “Clearly, the panel believes that the ultra-low interest rates and targeted injections of liquidity into the economy have had a major effect on the stock market,” said <a href="https://rady.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/timmermann/">Allan Timmermann</a>, an economist at the University of California, San Diego who has also been consulting with FiveThirtyEight on the survey.</p>
<p>There was also a small &#8212; though not nonexistent &#8212; weight given to the possibility that this is all just an irrational bubble in prices, poised to burst.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is telling, however, that the lowest-weighted option available was genuine optimism on the part of investors. As we’ve said, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-stock-market-is-not-the-economy/">the stock market is <i>not</i> the economy</a>.</p>
<p>Looking at the whole picture, most economists think the U.S. could have done a better job at initially controlling the virus through more aggressive lockdowns, which in turn would have landed the country in a better economic place. Lawmakers also still have choices that can materially affect the economy’s trajectory throughout 2021 &#8212; and so do voters. Just how much we second-guess <i>those </i>decisions, though, remains to be seen.</p>
