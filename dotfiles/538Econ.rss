<p data-paragraph="main">The NBA trade deadline has come and gone, and it was quite a doozy. There’s been a whole lot of moving and shaking over the last week or so — and not just among teams looking to make financially motivated moves. We had some real, live, landscape-altering trades.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/james-harden-and-ben-simmons-got-the-moves-they-wanted-will-they-work-out-for-their-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We already covered</a> the league-changing James Harden-Ben Simmons deal last week; now, let’s go through the rest of the league. The moves made ahead of the deadline fall into several different categories: those for teams focused on the future, for teams rolling the dice on certain players, for teams making targeted upgrades before the playoffs, and for teams going all-in on the play-in game.</p>



<h2 id="all-in-for-the-play-in"><strong>All-in for the play-in</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>New Orleans Pelicans, Sacramento Kings</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New Orleans sent Josh Hart, Nickeil Alexander-Walker,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander-Walker was later traded again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a> Tomáš Satoranský, Didi Louzada, a protected 2022 first-round pick<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portland receives the pick this year unless it falls between picks 1 and 4 or 15 and 30, in which case it rolls over to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> and two future second-round picks <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33244215/sources-portland-trail-blazers-sending-cj-mccollum-new-orleans-pelicans-part-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the Portland Trail Blazers</a> (more on them later) for CJ McCollum, Larry Nance Jr. and Tony Snell.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCollum’s contract is onerous, he’s a small guard on the wrong side of 30, and he’s dealt with injury issues over the past couple seasons. But he is a <a href="https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1491219573898579971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professional Scorer</a> who gives Brandon Ingram (and Zion Williamson, if he ever returns to the floor) a better perimeter creator to work with than they’ve had at any time in the recent past. His <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html#adj_shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-between game</a> should give him a chance to develop strong two-man chemistry with Jonas Valančiūnas, much like he did with Jusuf Nurkić in Portland. He’s also experienced at taking advantage of second-side opportunities like the ones Ingram can create for him, thanks to his extensive history with Damian Lillard. (Lillard, obviously, could create better opportunities than Ingram can.) Nance is a nice fit in the lineup as a replacement for Hart, but he also <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33256734/larry-nance-jr-recently-traded-new-orleans-pelicans-expected-6-weeks-knee-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs knee surgery</a> and is expected to miss up to six weeks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Pellies are 21-23 <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since their disastrous</a> 1-11 start to the season, and they apparently fancy themselves a playoff squad. Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAPTOR-based projection system</a> initially bumped New Orleans’s chances of making the playoffs by a few percentage points, but only to 35 percent. It’s one thing to go all-in to make the NBA Finals, but wholly another to do it in an effort to make it through the play-in tournament and thus earn the right to get smoked by the Phoenix Suns or Golden State Warriors in the first round. Was the price the Pelicans paid in this deal worth that much, if they’re still not even a 50-50 bet to play real playoff games? (The play-in is not the playoffs, folks. It might be the postseason, but it’s not the real tournament.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Kings made a similar all-in push, though they were 20-35 at the time of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33244860/indiana-pacers-sacramento-kings-work-six-player-trade-includes-domantas-sabonis-tyrese-haliburton-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their big trade for Domantas Sabonis</a>. When you <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t made the playoffs</a> in 16 years, even an outside shot at grabbing the No. 10 seed is apparently too enticing to pass up. I feel sort of bad that Sabonis has been slighted in the wake of Sacramento’s trade, which sent Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson to Indiana for Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb and a top-55 protected second-round pick, along with the two-time All-Star big man. Sabonis is <em>really good</em>, and one of the few guys in the league who is basically a guaranteed 20-10-5 on a nightly basis. We saw in his first two games with the team just <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/article258234593.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what kind of effect</a> he can have on an offense. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The issue many observers (myself included) have with the deal is the inclusion of Haliburton, who looks like he has the potential to be a foundation-of-the-offense type of guard. He can play on and off the ball, has shot <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/halibty01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better</a> than 40 percent from deep in each of his first two seasons, is a solid rebounder, can defend multiple positions and still has plenty of room for growth, given his <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/halibty01.html#advanced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">below-average</a> usage rate. Producing like he already has (14.3 points, 3.9 rebounds, 7.4 assists per game prior to the trade) while filling a decidedly complimentary role is impressive. He is simply not the kind of player teams should be trading away while still on his rookie contract. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sacramento’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260382/sacramento-kings-acquire-donte-divincenzo-part-four-team-trade-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up deal</a> in which it acquired Donte DiVincenzo, Trey Lyles and Josh Jackson for Marvin Bagley III was a much stronger move. Salvaging any sort of value for Bagley, who has disappointed since being tabbed as the No. 2 overall pick in the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 NBA draft</a>, would have been a win. Acquiring DiVincenzo — who, remember, the Kings wanted to get in the failed Bogdan Bogdanović <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/21/bucks-lose-2022-draft-pick-bogdan-bogdanovic-trade-violate-tampering-rules#:~:text=The%20NBA%20has%20stripped%20the,free%20agency%20discussions%20were%20allowed." target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign-and-trade</a> in the “summer” of 2020 — is a nice move. He’s been <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/divindo01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rusty</a> this year since coming back from an ankle injury that knocked him out of last year’s title run, but he makes a ton of sense as a dribble hand-off partner for Sabonis and a second-side threat to play off of De’Aaron Fox. If he can rediscover his shooting touch, he should at least help Lamb and Holiday approximate what the team lost in Hield. Plus, Lyles is having the best season of his career and has become a respectable backup big man, and should fit better on this team than did Thompson.</p>



<h2 id="targeted-upgrades"><strong>Targeted upgrades</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Cleveland Cavaliers, Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, Charlotte Hornets, Los Angeles Clippers</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the group of teams that, in my opinion, did the best work at (or near) the deadline.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Cavaliers <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33232735/sources-cleveland-cavs-acquire-caris-levert-trade-indiana-pacers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Caris LeVert and a second-round pick for Ricky Rubio (who is out for the season), a lottery-protected first-round pick and two seconds. LeVert has come off the bench in his first few games with the team but quickly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkswPWfrZr8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rediscovered his chemistry</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Z0zvJwAmQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once</a> and future teammate Jarrett Allen and also played as part of Cleveland’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/playbyplay/_/gameId/401360644" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing</a> five-man unit. He’s very much a Rorschach test kind of player, good at a bunch of things but not necessarily great at any of them. With the Cavs sapped of their guard depth, though, they desperately needed someone who can create off the bounce. LeVert can definitely do that, alleviating some of the pressure on Darius Garland to do it all on his own. LeVert averages 16.3 drives per game, <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives/?sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th-most</a> in the NBA. He’s also still 27 years old and under contract for next year, so the Cavs can more comfortably let the currently injured Collin Sexton walk if some other team signs him to an offer sheet in free agency this summer. They paid a high price, but for a player tailor-made to fill their biggest current role hole.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Bucks snagged Serge Ibaka (and two future second-round picks) in the aforementioned DiVincenzo deal. It may or may not signal some pessimism on their part regarding Brook Lopez’s return from his back surgery, though the Bucks did recently <a href="https://twitter.com/JamalCollier/status/1491227838267248640?s=20&amp;t=PTefXB6LQlamP9pBZVp8ZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">express hope</a> that they’ll get their starting center back this season. Ibaka is solid insurance just in case they don’t, and he can spare Bobby Portis from the ultra-heavy minute load he’s been carrying during the regular season — provided Ibaka himself can remain healthy. After the Bucks apparently chose Grayson Allen (acquired and then <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32425654/grayson-allen-agrees-2-year-20m-extension-milwaukee-bucks-agent-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended</a> this past offseason) over DiVincenzo, they figured out a way to turn the latter into a potentially valuable piece before having to deal with his restricted free agency. Their wing depth is a little thin without DiVincenzo, but they also played without him to begin the season and can scour the buyout market if they get the feeling that George Hill and/or Pat Connaughton won’t make it back in time to be a factor in the playoffs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Raptors <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260476/sources-toronto-raptors-send-goran-dragic-picks-san-antonio-spurs-thad-young-drew-eubanks-pick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> Goran Dragić and a protected first-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for Thaddeus Young, Drew Eubanks<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="3" href="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-waive-drew-eubanks-san-antonio-spurs-trade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;then waived&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a> and a second-round pick via the Detroit Pistons. They continue stocking up on players who are all basically the same size and have incredibly long arms. With the exception of Fred VanVleet, every player in Toronto’s rotation is between 6-foot-5 and 6-foot-9 and weighs between 200 (Chris Boucher) and 235 pounds (Young). Toronto coach Nick Nurse loves to get <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-raptors-defense-is-almost-never-the-same-but-its-always-really-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as creative as possible with his defenses</a>, and Young is plenty capable of handling whatever gets thrown at him. Toronto’s roster is still a bit frontcourt-heavy, but giving Nurse another player he can trust on D so that he doesn’t have to heap so many minutes onto his starters has a lot of value. Toronto also did this only in exchange for moving back in the draft as opposed to out of it entirely, thanks to acquiring Detroit’s second-rounder this year in the deal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Breaking with Danny Ainge’s long-standing tradition of <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/6/22369749/danny-ainge-celtics-almost-trades-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost making deals</a> and then going on WEEI to talk about how close he was to making deals, new Celtics president Brad Stevens made three swaps on Thursday. He <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260889/sources-boston-celtics-acquire-guard-derrick-white-san-antonio-spurs-multiplayer-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> Josh Richardson, Romeo Langford, a protected first-round pick and a future pick swap to the Spurs for Derrick White; Dennis Schröder, Enes Kanter Freedom and Bruno Fernando <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33261566/boston-celtics-deal-dennis-schroder-enes-freedom-houston-rockets-daniel-theis-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the</a> Houston Rockets for Daniel Theis; and P.J. Dozier, Bol Bol, a future second-round pick and cash to the Orlando Magic <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1491826775030181893" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for</a> a future second-round pick. The trio of moves got Boston an upgrade to their closing lineup (who also improves a defense that has been the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=01%2F01%2F2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">league’s best</a> since the calendar turned to 2022) and a backup big man who Ime Udoka can trust on defense, while also ducking the luxury tax line. Not bad for a day’s work. White has fit in spectacularly well early on, and should help Boston continue its rise up the standings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Suns <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260921/phoenix-suns-finalizing-trade-reacquire-torrey-craig-indiana-pacers-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">salvaged</a> some value out of Jalen Smith, sending him along with a second-round pick to the Pacers in exchange for Torrey Craig, who played a valuable role in their run to the NBA Finals last season. Smith was a surprise pick when the Suns took him at No. 10 overall in 2020 and then didn’t do much as a rookie, so the team <a href="https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2021/11/3/22759864/just-how-rare-is-phoenix-suns-declining-jalen-smiths-third-year-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined</a> his third-year option. When pressed into action due to injuries this year, though, Smith <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithja04/gamelog/2022#39-48-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked pretty good</a>. The Suns probably would not have been able to retain him in free agency due to salary-cap quirks, so thought it better to get a potential playoff rotation player now than lose him for nothing later. Phoenix <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/wizards-suns-trade-holiday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also sent</a> cash to the Washington Wizards for Aaron Holiday, who gives them an upgrade on Elfrid Payton as the backup point guard while Cameron Payne is out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Hornets have badly needed help at center for a while now and <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/hornets-wizards-montrezl-harrell-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got some</a> in the form of Montrezl Harrell, sending Vernon Carey and Ish Smith to the Washington Wizards in exchange. After getting off to a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harremo01/gamelog/2022#388-404-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spectacular start</a> to the season, Harrell hasn’t been as effective of late, and the return of Thomas Bryant meant the Wizards had a playing-time crunch at the position. It’s easy to see Harrell splitting the pivot minutes with Mason Plumlee as he did with Daniel Gafford, and to see him feasting on the board and pick-and-roll feeds from LaMelo Ball and Terry Rozier; but he unfortunately will not solve Charlotte’s rim-protection issues. The Hornets have allowed the second-most <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022.html#shooting-opponent::28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dunks</a> and 12<sup>th</sup>-most <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022.html#shooting-opponent::28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layups</a> in the NBA this season. Harrell is — to put it as kindly as possible — a <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpar</a> rim-protector.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Clippers <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33216994/sources-la-clippers-acquire-norman-powell-portland-trail-blazers-5-player-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off</a> the series of deadline deals by sending Eric Bledsoe, Justise Winslow, Keon Johnson and a 2025 second-round pick to the Blazers for Norman Powell and Robert Covington. Yes, they turned one rotation player into two and didn’t have to give up much to do it. Powell, unfortunately, is out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nba.com/news/clippers-norman-powell-broken-foot" target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indefinitely</a> with a foot injury suffered late last week, but they&#8217;re building a Raptors-style roster with a bunch of different-sized wings who can play alongside Kawhi Leonard and/or Paul George. Ya know, if those guys ever get healthy.</p>



<h2 id="rolling-the-dice"><strong>Rolling the dice</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Detroit Pistons, Dallas Mavericks, Washington Wizards, Utah Jazz</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Pistons are getting a free look at Bagley before he’s a restricted free agent this summer. He should get plenty of minutes as he attempts to rehab his value. If it doesn’t work out, well, they didn’t give up much anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Mavs and Wizards &#8230; wow. Dallas <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33261228/sources-dallas-mavericks-trading-kristaps-porzingis-washington-wizards-spencer-dinwiddie-davis-bertans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> Kristaps Porziņģis and a second-round pick to Washington for Spencer Dinwiddie and Dāvis Bertāns, then <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1491890012228665352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lavished</a> Dorian Finney-Smith with a four-year, $52 million contract extension. KP has been out since late January with the latest flare-up of his recurring knee issues, and it’ll be interesting to see whether there is something more serious going on than the reported soreness that’s been keeping him off the floor. Either way, it’s safe to say that Dallas’s gamble to acquire him from the New York Knicks a few years back did not work out as expected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dinwiddie wasn’t particularly good in Washington, and Bertāns has been a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bertada01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disaster</a> since signing a new deal during the 2020 offseason. Neither player is much of a defender, and Dinwiddie isn’t much of a shooting threat, but the Mavs did need some secondary ball-handling help, and if Bertāns can rediscover his stroke, he can help replace Tim Hardaway Jr.’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tim-hardaway-jr-found-a-home-and-a-rhythm-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">role off the bench</a> in the wake of the latter’s injury. Dinwiddie also provides insurance in case pending unrestricted free agent Jalen Brunson walks in the offseason. He should have plenty of suitors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Remember how good the Russell Westbrook trade <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-russell-westbrook-trade-is-working-out-for-the-wizards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was looking</a> for the Wizards earlier this year? Well, it still looks pretty good, given <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/russell-westbrook-benched-again-as-shooting-woes-continue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what’s going on</a> with Russ. It’s just that the team hasn’t looked that good in a while, so it made sense to go in a different direction. The question here is whether the Wizards were just looking to get off of bad money or they think Porziņģis is a franchise building block for them. (Based on coach Wes Unseld Jr.’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ChaseHughesNBCS/status/1491995046584987649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public comments</a>, it might be the latter.) Oh, and whether Porziņģis’s presence is enough to entice Bradley Beal (out for the season after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33246228/left-wrist-surgery-end-season-washington-wizards-star-guard-bradley-beal-agent-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrist surgery</a>) to re-sign with the team on a deal it’s not clear they should want to give him in the first place. KP hasn’t been that guy in quite a while, but if he can come back from this knee issue, he should have a chance to play more of a leading role in the offense down the stretch of this season. His floor-spacing ability makes him a good theoretical fit with Beal, but tying the team’s future to that duo could be very, very risky given their respective injury histories and contract values.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Joe Ingles’s expiring contract was supposed to be Utah’s big trade piece at the deadline. The torn ACL that knocked him <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33215700/utah-jazz-joe-ingles-insists-career-continue-acl-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out for the year</a> changed all of that, though, so the Jazz had to settle for a much smaller return than expected. Acquiring Alexander-Walker and Juancho Hernangómez <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/jazz-acquire-nickeil-alexander-walker-juancho-hernangomez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in exchange for</a> Ingles, Elijah Hughes and a future second theoretically lengthens their rotation a bit — but that’s only true if coach Quin Snyder trusts them to keep the line moving offensively and execute on defense. Count me as skeptical on both the former (for Alexander-Walker) and the latter (for Hernangómez).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="focused-on-the-future"><strong>Focused on the future</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Portland Trail Blazers, San Antonio Spurs, Indiana Pacers</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Damian Lillard’s abdominal injury and subsequent surgery finally got Portland to acknowledge that its roster had “<a href="https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1491894674742673428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plateaued</a>,” as interim general manager Joe Cronin put it on Thursday. The Blazers’ three trades netted Bledsoe, Winslow, Johnson and a 2025 second-round pick from the Clippers; Hart, Louzada, a protected first-round pick and two future second-round picks from the Pelicans; and Ingles, Hughes and a future second-round pick from the Jazz in <a href="https://www.nba.com/jazz/jazz-acquire-alexander-walker-and-hernangomez#:~:text=The%20Utah%20Jazz%20have%20acquired,future%20second%2Dround%20draft%20pick." target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchange</a> for Alexander-Walker, whom they’d received as part of the initial McCollum deal. Don’t expect to see Dame for the rest of this season. Instead, it’s a full-on tank job and a lot of money in Anfernee Simons’s future. Probably.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Spurs are on track to miss the playoffs for the third consecutive season for the first time in franchise history. White, at 27 years old, probably did not fit their timeline, and getting both a first-round pick and a pick swap from the Celtics probably made sense. Meanwhile, perhaps <a href="https://grantland.com/features/the-shot-doctor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famed shooting coach</a> Chip Engelland can repair Landford’s jumper and turn him into a contributor. Maybe they can even get something for Richardson down the line. Young was not playing all that often for the Spurs, and getting a first-round pick for him was a coup — especially considering he could very well have been a buyout guy had he not been traded. After he came to San Antonio along with a first as part of the DeMar DeRozan sign-and-trade, the Spurs essentially turned a player they weren’t likely to re-sign into two future first-round picks. They now have three firsts in the 2022 draft, which they can either use to take some swings or package together to move up. Their willingness to go in this direction is interesting considering they’ve essentially never undergone a rebuild before. Perhaps Gregg Popovich is willing to stick it out through the rest of this era, until the team is set up to succeed into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indiana had to part with Sabonis and a few quality role players but made out quite well. Haliburton, as mentioned, is a potential foundational piece. They can give Jalen Smith a shot on the front line along with 2021 first-rounder Isaiah Jackson, while Myles Turner allows his foot injury to heal. This summer, the Pacers can go even further by seeing what they can get for Turner and/or Malcolm Brogdon, or they can try to remain semi-competitive by keeping those guys and allowing them to support Haliburton’s growth. Either way, it was clear that this version of their team had run its course, and they have attempted a pivot to the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When ice hockey player Amanda Kessel got a concussion, she thought she was doing the right thing by resting. But her migraines and dizziness didn’t improve, and she became anxious and depressed. As it turns out, rest is no longer the recommended treatment for athletes suffering from prolonged concussions. In fact, it can make them worse. It was only once Amanda started a new course of treatment involving exercise and medication that she got back on the ice. And now, she’s once again going for gold at the Olympics.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Super Bowl LVI between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals was a fitting finish to an NFL season that began in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-first-week-of-the-nfl-season-was-pure-chaos-what-does-that-mean-for-the-rest-of-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically chaotic</a> fashion. L.A. somehow managed to trot out the worst rushing attack in Super Bowl history. The officials appeared to miss an important penalty that led to a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33043281/questionable-nfl-playoff-officiating-decisions-happened-which-were-right-came-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tee Higgins touchdown</a> to start the second half, then threw a <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/02/13/super-bowl-2022-rams-winning-td-fueled-by-controversial-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial flag</a> that kept the Rams’ go-ahead scoring drive alive. Both starting quarterbacks suffered lower body injuries (but managed to stay in the game), and Rams receiver Odell Beckham Jr. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33284663/los-angeles-rams-wide-receiver-odell-beckham-jr-questionable-return-suffering-leg-injury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left in the second quarter</a> with a noncontact knee injury and did not return. After the final snap, L.A. safety Taylor Rapp <a href="https://twitter.com/RamsNFL/status/1493064289883590662?s=20&amp;t=NJLgUMU3PqMPq_xgPh_5UA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed to his girlfriend</a>. And receiver Van Jefferson’s wife, Samaria, <a href="https://twitter.com/JourdanRodrigue/status/1493065465962262535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went into labor</a> during the game. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the midst of all that, the Rams won the second Super Bowl in <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise history</a> by relying on two of their many stars. But it wasn’t the big-name hired guns who led Los Angeles to the Lombardi Trophy; instead, it was the team’s homegrown superstars who made the difference at SoFi Stadium.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">L.A. had fallen behind Cincinnati on the first play of the second half and struggled from then on to sustain its offense. But everything changed when the team started manufacturing touches for star wideout Cooper Kupp. The Rams looked to Kupp eight times on the decisive 18-play drive,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a> beginning with a 7-yard run on fourth-and-1 from the L.A. 30-yard line. Kupp sprinkled in catches for 8, 22 and 8 yards before drawing a defensive holding penalty on third-and-goal at the 8-yard line with 1:47 left in the game. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The next two Kupp targets were also nullified by penalties, including a touchdown that was called back due to offsetting penalties on both teams. But Kupp’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=togpppH-PVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back-shoulder catch</a> on quarterback Matthew Stafford’s toss on second-and-goal from the 1 ultimately put the Rams ahead with 1:25 remaining &#8212; and secured Kupp the title of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33285438/cooper-kupp-named-mvp-super-bowl-lvi-late-td-lifts-los-angeles-rams-cincinnati-bengals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Bowl Most Valuable Player</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the game wasn’t over until <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-bengals-slow-down-aaron-donald-nothings-stopped-him-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rams&#8217; other superstar</a>, Aaron Donald, officially shut the door on the Bengals’ comeback attempt. In what may end up being <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/02/13/aaron-donald-could-consider-retirement-if-rams-win-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his last NFL snap</a>, Donald closed out the game with a hit on Joe Burrow on fourth down, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMLF7AkgDAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spinning the Bengals QB to the ground</a> and forcing him to throw an off-balance pass short of running back Samaje Perine. The play punctuated a night of defensive dominance for Los Angeles: The Rams’ defensive line created pressure against the Bengals’ offensive line on 82.1 percent of their defensive snaps, <a href="https://twitter.com/SethWalder/status/1493058077909737476" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of any team in any game in the NFL this season</a>. The Rams converted that pressure into seven sacks, with Donald and Von Miller tying for the team lead with two apiece.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">L.A. needed Super Bowl MVP-caliber performances from Kupp and Donald in large part because the team was historically inept at running the ball against a stout Bengals run defense. L.A. averaged just 1.9 yards per rush, <a href="https://stathead.com/football/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rush_yds_per_att&amp;year_min=1940&amp;year_max=2021&amp;game_type=P&amp;playoff_round=s&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99&amp;temperature_gtlt=lt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worst ever among Super Bowl winners</a>. Running back Cam Akers rushed 13 times for just 21 yards, and he never really stood a chance. The Rams’ offensive line was unable to open holes for him all night long: Akers netted <em>negative</em> <em>1</em> yard rushing before first contact.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Behind center, Stafford struggled after Beckham left the game. In the first half, with Beckham playing a heavy role, Stafford scored a Raw Quarterback Rating of 72.2, completing 12 of 18 passes for 165 yards, two touchdowns and an arm-punt interception in the end zone that was basically harmless. In the second half, his Raw QBR dropped to 47.9 on 14 of 22 passing for 118 yards, one touchdown and one interception. In the end, Stafford was serviceable but unspectacular, and it wasn’t until head coach and play caller Sean McVay decided to funnel the Rams’ offense through Kupp that L.A. returned to the form it showed before Beckham got hurt. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The game itself mirrored <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2021.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Ram’s season</a>, with L.A. starting hot before falling into a funk at the midway point and then finishing strong with elite performances from its star players. And that was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-and-bengals-took-opposite-paths-to-the-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always the plan for the Rams</a> this season after going all-in for Stafford, Miller and Beckham. All they needed was to avoid injuries to bring general manager Les Snead’s vision to fruition.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Injuries nearly caught up with them in the biggest game of the year. But in the end, it was the elite, homegrown talent of Kupp and Donald &#8212; rather than the more recent additions via <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2021/03/18/detroit-lions-matthew-stafford-trade-los-angeles-rams-official-jared-goff/4744369001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile trades</a> &#8212; that has L.A. celebrating its first Rams Super Bowl victory in the city’s history.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Daryl Morey waited and waited &#8230; and waited some more. It took months of criticism over holding onto disgruntled All-Star Ben Simmons and sacrificing trade leverage in hopes of acquiring stars who were seemingly not available, but the president of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers finally got the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260613/brooklyn-nets-trade-james-harden-philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-seth-curry-andre-drummond-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superstar player he wanted</a>: James Harden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After an offseason spent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-trades-of-all-stars-can-tell-us-about-why-ben-simmons-is-still-in-philly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to deal</a> the discontented Simmons and half a season with the player sitting out, the Sixers found a landing spot for him at Thursday’s trade deadline, sending Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1491841872641368064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two first-round picks</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their own 2022 first-rounder, which the Nets have the right to defer to 2023, along with their protected 2027 first-rounder, which Brooklyn gets so long as it falls outside the top eight picks. If it is inside the top eight, it rolls over to 2028, top-eight protected again, then becomes two second-round picks and $2 million the following year. To legally make the trade, the 76ers also have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dn4sty/status/1491843458981670918&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;unprotect&lt;/a&gt; the 2025 first-round pick they owe to the Oklahoma City Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a> to the Brooklyn Nets. In exchange, Philly got the Nets star, who had demanded (implicitly through his actions, if not necessarily his words) a trade of his own, along with Paul Millsap. As Joel Embiid said, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelEmbiid/status/1491120272178561028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“This is WILD</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Brooklyn, the deal brings its Big Three to an abrupt end just 13 months after the Nets <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30706097/sources-houston-rockets-trade-james-harden-brooklyn-nets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed all of their trade chips</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince, unprotected first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026 and pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a> to the middle of the table to acquire Harden from the Houston Rockets and pair him with fellow stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. But instead of an instant title, injury and the Milwaukee Bucks (and Durant’s <a href="https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1406469209434083330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too-big shoes</a>) cut the Nets’ 2020-21 season short. This year, Durant’s latest injury (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33079028/brooklyn-nets-say-kevin-durant-diagnosed-sprained-mcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sprained MCL</a>) and Irving’s refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine meant Harden was often flying solo on the court rather than working as part of a star trio. That simply wasn’t part of the deal, and he was apparently quite <a href="https://theathletic.com/3123409/2022/02/10/kyrie-irvings-role-in-james-harden-trade-and-is-zion-williamson-the-next-big-name-to-move-trade-deadline-first-thoughts/?source=nbatw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frustrated</a> by it. Between this season and last, Harden, Durant and Irving spent only 365 minutes on the floor together, <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2021-22,2020-21&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935,202681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to PBP Stats</a>. They obliterated opponents by 14.17 points per 100 possessions during that time, with an offense that would have registered as the best in league history by an enormous margin. But that didn’t seem to happen often enough to persuade Harden that he wanted to be in Brooklyn beyond this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harden now heads to Philadelphia, where his new co-star is at least a semi-regular figure in the lineup. Embiid has <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never played more than 78 percent</a> of his team’s games in a given season, but he’s been out there far more often than either Durant or Irving over the past few years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not necessarily a perfect fit. Harden has been at his best with a rim-rolling pick-and-roll partner who provides vertical spacing so he can do damage off the drive, step into space to isolate or fling the ball to shooters dotting the perimeter. The Sixers have rarely run pick and rolls in the last half-decade, though that is at least in part because of Simmons’s deficiencies as a halfcourt ball-handler. Embiid also isn’t much of a vertical threat, preferring instead to roll himself into post position at the nail or on the block, where he can do damage against overmatched defenders. He’s one of the most efficient high-volume post players in the league, so that tactic has worked quite well for Philadelphia. (It remains to be seen how he’ll react when Harden goes into his tap-dance-style stepback three routine after he draws a switch, rather than dumping the ball to the big fella.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The post-centric offense occasionally turns non-Embiid Sixers into spot-up threats, though, and Harden is one of the most catch-and-shoot-averse players in the league. To wit: He has <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*harden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted</a> only 40 three-pointers off the catch this season, according to NBA Advanced Stats.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&rsquo;t unusual for him: he took just 40 all of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2020-21&amp;amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;amp;dir=1&amp;amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*harden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; and only 85 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2019-20&amp;amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;amp;dir=1&amp;amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*harden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the year before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a> Nine of his new Philadelphia teammates have <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*phi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken more</a>, including Shake Milton, who has played in only 27 games. It’ll be interesting to see if he’s more willing to shoot off the catch in Philly than he was in Brooklyn.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/HardenCatch.mp4"></video></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then there’s the defensive end of the floor. Harden has historically approached non-disaster status on defense only when involved in a switch-heavy scheme that minimized the amount of work he had to do. Philly, by contrast, rarely switches because Embiid is one of the best drop-coverage defenders in basketball — if not the best. The Sixers want to keep Embiid as close to the paint as possible within their scheme, and it makes sense for them to do that. A drop scheme means everyone else needs to be helping and recovering elsewhere on the floor. Having to do things like fight over screens or help off the wing and into the paint before jetting back out to his man on the perimeter will be a change of pace for Harden, and it remains to be seen whether he is willing to commit to doing either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, both Harden and Embiid are essentially top-flight offenses unto themselves. The Sixers can stagger their minutes (assuming head coach Doc Rivers can be coaxed into avoiding his <a href="http://www.backsportspage.com/doc-rivers-and-the-all-bench-lineups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-bench lineups</a>) and ensure they have a <a href="https://theathletic.com/1427059/2019/12/06/the-new-nba-heliocentrism-how-teams-revolve-more-around-todays-stars-than-they-ever-have-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heliocentric star</a> on the court at all times. That may have an effect on Tyrese Maxey — who <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maxeyty01/gamelog/2022#72-80-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excelled</a> during the stretch Embiid missed earlier in the season due to COVID-19 and then went through an <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maxeyty01/gamelog/2022#81-87-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjustment period</a> after Embiid came back — but the second-year guard has proved <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maxeyty01/gamelog/2022#88-108-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capable</a> of adapting to his circumstances. Attaching Maxey and Embiid in the rotation while Harden plays more often with the better-shooting Tobias Harris makes a good degree of sense. They can then rotate Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz and Georges Niang in and out to make sure there’s enough shooting and/or defense to suit the purposes of any given lineup.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This version of the Sixers also figures to turn games into free-throw contests quite often, given the penchant of both Harden and Embiid for drawing fouls. It might not be pretty, but it’ll likely be very tough to stop. It was initially reported that Harden had <a href="https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2022/02/10/sixers-star-james-harden-will-opt-in-to-his-contract-for-2022-23-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opted into</a> his $47.4 million player option for next season as part of the deal, though subsequent <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleNeubeck/status/1492164002264371200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> contradicted that notion. Harden can still opt in this summer, or he can choose to opt out and re-sign on a long-term deal. Either way, the Sixers likely have a short window in which to test this out and try to win a title before things potentially become untenable with a new contract for Harden in his mid-to-late 30s.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there’s Brooklyn. Durant remains out with his knee injury. Irving can still play only in road games. Joe Harris <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33211223/brooklyn-nets-joe-harris-need-second-surgery-left-ankle-agent-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may need a second surgery</a> on his left ankle. Simmons will continue to work with his therapist to <a href="https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1491841027153412096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get mentally ready</a> to play, according to ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne, and we don’t yet know when he’ll see the floor. And the team is already in the midst of a spiral, having <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost 10 consecutive games</a> as it dealt with injury and Harden’s transparent and somewhat embarrassing efforts to get himself traded.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In theory, Simmons is an excellent fit alongside Durant and Irving. His abilities to defend multiple positions and get a team into its transition offense are incredibly valuable, particularly on a squad that can space the floor the way Brooklyn can when it has everyone healthy. He’s never been afforded the luxury of playing in all that much space because he came into the league on a team already featuring Embiid, who parked himself in the post early and often. (And with great success.) The incumbent stars’ ability to manufacture offense on their own will take pressure off of Simmons to be a lead creator — and free him to solely do the things he does well.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="8" href="#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we should acknowledge here that Simmons&rsquo;s decision to sit out games rather than report to the 76ers ended up getting him exactly what he wanted: He&rsquo;s no longer in Philly, but he&rsquo;s still on a contender, and he doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with being an afterthought searching for his place in Rivers&rsquo;s Embiid-centric offense. It may not have been all that professional, but you can&rsquo;t say it didn&rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a> It’s often been posited that Simmons could play a Draymond Green-like role in half-court offense, and it’s easy to envision him and Curry (or him and Irving) developing dribble hand-off chemistry that leverages the latter’s shooting ability and Simmons’s brilliant floor vision to bend defenses to their breaking points. (Curry remains one of the league’s best snipers, and he will help Patty Mills fill the hole Harris has left in the lineup while also providing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nbas-best-supporting-cast-best-level-up-and-more-of-our-midseason-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more of an off-the-bounce threat</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we saw with Harden, though, there’s no guarantee that the Nets’ new star trio actually shares the floor for significant time. And without Irving, Durant or Harris in the lineup, Curry and Mills are the team&#8217;s only floor-spacers of note. (Unless you count Cam Thomas, who is always willing to shoot.) What happens if and when Simmons is on the floor in a lineup that not only isn’t particularly conducive to space, but also doesn’t have a player who can be the foundation of the halfcourt offense?&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brooklyn should be able to build a fascinating, switch-happy defense around Simmons, Durant and Nicolas Claxton, but KD’s health is no guarantee, and a Simmons-Claxton pairing might be unworkable in halfcourt offense unless at least two of the shooters are out there with them. Durant is the only plus defender among the team’s shooters, though, which means those Simmons-Claxton units might not be as potent defensively as you’d ideally want them to be. The Nets can slide Bruce Brown, James Johnson or Jevon Carter in there to help the defense, but they’re non-shooters as well, and that makes things complicated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Simmons gives the Nets the type of player they did not have last year: the guy who can guard the opposing team’s best player, regardless of position. He is one of the league’s most versatile defenders, a 6-foot-11, 240-pound wrecking ball who is capable of handling nearly any player in the league one-on-one. Among 251 players who played 1,000 or more minutes last season, he ranked fifth in Bball-Index’s Defensive Versatility metric. That wasn’t unusual: He ranked 11th in 2019-20 and second in 2018-19. He is a virtual lock to spare Durant the trouble of defending Giannis Antetokounmpo if the Nets meet the Bucks in the playoffs again, and that alone might make him worth the trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this assumes Simmons is ready, able and willing to play basketball, though, and again, we do not know if or when that will happen. His youth and the two first-round picks Brooklyn received in the deal might extend the Nets’s championship window, but that window is almost certainly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not open as wide now</a> as many expected it to be when the Nets began the season among the title favorites.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also don&rsquo;t know whether Irving, who &mdash; unlike Durant &mdash; was not signed to a contract extension last offseason, will be on the team long term. So, there&rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a> Given the team’s obvious ambitions when it made the Harden trade last year, that has to be disappointing.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for Philly, this deal has to be Morey’s dream come true; he has been adamant in the past that any team with at least a <a href="https://grantland.com/features/why-teams-just-5-percent-chance-competing-nba-championship-go-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 percent chance of winning the title</a> should be all in. With Embiid playing at an MVP level, he <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rightfully believes</a> that his Sixers are in that group of teams. Rivers now has a little more than two months to figure out how best to make the Harden and Embiid pairing work. Morey’s philosophy has always been to get the stars and worry about everything else later. He’s got the stars, but now, now <em>is </em>later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Super Bowl on Sunday pits an established team that’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/matthew-stafford-gave-the-rams-a-shot-at-a-title-the-rams-gave-stafford-a-shot-at-canton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone all-in</a> against a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/joe-burrow-jamarr-chase-and-the-bengals-are-ahead-of-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot up-and-comer</a>. There are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-bengals-slow-down-aaron-donald-nothings-stopped-him-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting matchups</a> to be found all over the field, but the most dynamic may be between each team’s star receiver: Cooper Kupp for the Los Angeles Rams vs. Ja’Marr Chase for the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kupp has put together one of the best receiving seasons in NFL history, churning out steady, spectacular production for the Rams week after week. Many will point to Kupp’s 1,947 receiving yards — <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rec_yds&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second most</a> in the regular season in NFL history<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2021 was the first regular season with 17 games. Kupp’s per-game average of 114.5 receiving yards per game &lt;a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;amp;order_by=rec_yds_per_g&amp;amp;year_min=1920&amp;amp;year_max=2021&amp;amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;height_min=0&amp;amp;height_max=99&amp;amp;weight_min=0&amp;amp;weight_max=500&amp;amp;bmi_min=0&amp;amp;bmi_max=100&amp;amp;undrafted=E&amp;amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;amp;draft_type=B&amp;amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;amp;conference=any&amp;amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ranks 11th all-time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a> as proof of his greatness. Others might nod to his consistency: Kupp posted fewer than 90 yards receiving in just <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KuppCo00/gamelog/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two games out of 20</a> this season. But perhaps most impressive was his efficiency. Kupp’s 3.28 receiving yards per route run from Week 1 through the playoffs ranks second among qualifying receivers since 2007,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first year for which we have data. Qualified receivers have at least 15 routes per team game in a given season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> and his share of receptions on routes run (23.9 percent) is fourth among qualifying receivers<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among players with at least two receptions per game in a given season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a> over those 15 seasons.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, Kupp won where you would expect him to win. He racked up more of his catches on short-to-intermediate outside routes than any other area of the field. He led the league in receptions on short outs — routes that break sharply to the sideline — hauling in 47 of his 170 receptions<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular season and playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a> there this season. Kupp made the catches count, too: He converted 22 into first downs, tops in the NFL. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, this really <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1332866872497287168?s=20&amp;t=R1eUHIzJp-sS3HsCxdXzKg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t much of a surprise</a> to anyone who has followed Kupp’s career. He’s well-known for his sharp route running, and he possesses an ability to patiently read the leverage of his defenders, then quickly change direction and break their ankles when they overcommit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the opposing sideline, Chase is known primarily as the opposite of Kupp: a deep threat that you can’t afford to leave singled up without help on the outside. The first-year sensation’s success running verts is a large part of the reason why he averaged the <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rec_yds_per_g&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eighth-most yards per game</a> ever for a rookie and compiled the <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rec_yds&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-most receiving yards</a> for a first-year receiver in NFL history.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, over a 17-game regular season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> It’s hard to think of Chase this season and not recall one of the many plays on which he just flat-out beat his opponent in a footrace to the end zone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/deep-td2.mp4"></video></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Chase was second in the league with 26 catches on vertical routes, racking up 758 yards while streaking upfield, often against defenders caught flat-footed trying to cover him deep one-on-one. His reputation is well-deserved. But if Chase was second in vertical success, which receiver was first? The (perhaps) surprising answer: Kupp.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kupp bested Chase in every statistical category deep, catching 28 balls for 857 yards. And that’s to take nothing away from Chase — there really weren’t any areas of the field where either receiver was a liability for their teams this year. It’s just that Kupp was so very good, well, everywhere.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img width="1150" height="1058" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-325408" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The sheer volume of short and intermediate routes the Rams ask Kupp to run is impressive enough, but head coach Sean McVay also lines Kupp up in so many locations that it’s hard to know what’s coming and when. Kupp attacked from the outside, from the slot, from bunch formations, after coming in motion, on choice routes where he lags behind and waits to make a decision on where to make his break, and even from the backfield. So perhaps it’s forgivable that when he puts his head down and sprints for the end zone, teams are taken by surprise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kupp-vert3.mp4"></video></figure><p data-paragraph="main">With Odell Beckham Jr. and Van Jefferson threatening deep when Kupp goes short, the defense is put in a no-win situation. And perhaps because of the bind he puts coverages in, Kupp was incredibly efficient deep: On passes between 30 and 40 yards in the air, Kupp caught 7 of 8 targets for 317 yards and a touchdown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Surely none of this is lost on the Bengals. Forced to choose whether to suffer a death by a thousand Kupps or risk getting beat over the top for a quick score, it’s likely Cincinnati will want to try to dictate the action at some point in Super Bowl LVI and bring pressure. But compounding the problem for the Bengals defense is that quarterback Matthew Stafford has built excellent chemistry with Kupp. Stafford has learned to anticipate his receiver’s reads, and he seems to trust him to make big plays, particularly when looking down the barrel of a blitz. Stafford scored an incredible 93.7 QBR — best in the league — against the blitz from Week 1 through the playoffs. Throws like this one to Kupp help explain his success.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/stafford-trust.mp4"></video></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Chase’s Bengals are a scrapy young team — young enough that they should be good for years to come — and many people will be rooting for them. But with Kupp in his prime and playing at a historic level with seemingly no weaknesses, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where Cincinnati defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo will be able to come up with enough answers to effectively contain him. Thanks to Kupp, the Rams’ all-in gamble this season looks likely to pay off.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Though figure skating competitions were hardly a new thing — they took place throughout the latter half of the 19th century — a formal world championship in the discipline had only been created in 1896. And up until Syers’s appearance, the only entrants had ever been men. Madge and her husband, Edgar, also a figure skater with whom she competed in pairs, realized that there was no explicit rule that prevented her from entering the event, which was to be held in London. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Loophole, meet Madge. She went ahead and entered.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The field was quite small, as they tended to be in those days; of the four competitors, Syers placed second, taking the silver behind Ulrich Salchow, who was at the beginning of a competitive run that would result in <a href="https://olympics.com/en/athletes/ulrich-salchow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 world titles</a> and one Olympic gold medal.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="15" href="#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name “Salchow” might sound familiar even to those who watch figure skating only during the Olympics because the Swedish skater innovated an edge jump that is still in use, albeit with more revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a> Syers — skating in her long black skirt, satin blouse, pearls, leather gloves and hat — impressed everyone, including Salchow himself, who, as legend has it, presented his gold medal to her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the next ISU Congress, when the issue of women competing against men came up, members decided to make explicit what had previously only been implicit: Women were not allowed to compete at the world championships. According to the British delegate to the ISU,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British were in the minority advocating for women to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a> the group’s reasoning was threefold: First, the dress “prevents the judges from seeing the feet.” Second, a judge might “judge a girl to whom he was attached.” And third, “it is difficult to compare women with men.” (Why a “lady” athlete potentially arousing libidinous feelings in a male judge is an excuse to keep women out of sport rather than the other way around is a question as old as time.) </p>

&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-17">17</sup></a> in 1903 — and again in 1904, when she retained her title by defeating Edgar, who placed second. (She also entered the European Championships in 1904 but had to withdraw after the figures due to injury.) By 1906, the ISU, at the urging of the British, had created a women’s category — or “ladies” category, as it was called <a href="https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1109826/isu-ladies-women-council-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until just last year</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="18" href="#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And still is by U.S. Figure Skating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-18">18</sup></a> — though until 1924, the winner of the women’s title wasn’t considered a world champion.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="19" href="#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even after 1924, “lady” was used as a modifier while male winners were simply “world champions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-19">19</sup></a> Syers dominated the new women’s event and won the <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/event_names/300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first women’s Olympic gold medal</a> in figure skating in 1908 alongside Salchow, who picked up the first men’s Olympic title in the discipline. (Syers also won the <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/results/12542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pairs bronze</a> with Edgar.) Syers retired from competition shortly thereafter due to poor health; she died from heart failure a week before her 36th birthday. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The story of Syers and her bold move to enter what was understood to be a men’s-only event all the way back in 1902 is worth knowing in and of itself. But it’s interesting to consider Syers’s story in the context of our current “crisis” over trans women competing in the women’s category. The way that so-called defenders of women’s sports talk, the women’s sporting categories exist to ensure that women have the opportunity to win medals, and if we let trans women compete, we are going to destroy women’s sports. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">What happened with Syers complicates this narrative. In the case of figure skating, the women’s category was created because this was the only way the powers that be would let them participate. This wasn’t about giving women opportunities to medal; women were explicitly excluded <em>after </em>Syers had proven herself more than medal-worthy. The creation of the women’s figure skating category wasn’t a gift bestowed on women. It was a consolation prize. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The inclusion of women in other athletic disciplines was also met with resistance. In the 1920s, after failing to persuade the International Olympic Committee and the International Amateur Athletic Federation to include track and field events for women in the Olympics, Alice Milliat created the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale, the institution behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_World_Games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women’s World Games</a>. The women’s track and field competition was a huge success, <a href="https://digital.la84.org/digital/collection/p17103coll10/id/85/rec/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracting around 20,000 spectators</a> to its first iteration in 1922, then a one-day event. It was the success of Milliat and the FSFI, not the International Olympic Committee’s desire to create opportunities for female athletes, that led to the inclusion of women’s track and field at the Olympics. The IOC, resigned to the existence of women’s sport, decided that it was preferable for them, and not some other renegade organization, to be in charge. They didn’t like the idea of women running and jumping and sweating, but they liked the idea of women controlling their own sporting events even less. </p>

We treat this arrangement not only as the way it has always been, but as the only way it could ever possibly be. But when Syers skated onto the ice in 1902, the idea of a separate category for female athletes in all sports wasn’t a foregone conclusion because women’s participation in high-level international competition also wasn’t a foregone conclusion. Women’s sport was still negotiating its right to exist, female athletes the right to participate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Probably owing to the newly imposed gender segregation, and the fact that early on it could be performed by women wearing Victorian-era attire, figure skating was one of the first Olympic sports open to women.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="20" href="#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founder of the modern Olympic movement, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, wasn’t exactly a fan of the idea of women competing in sports at all. In all likelihood he thought their role would be better suited to placing wreaths on the heads of the male medalists instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-20">20</sup></a> Just two years after the women’s-only category was created by the ISU, men’s and women’s figure skating were added to the 1908 Olympics, in addition to men’s figures and pairs. (Pairs placed a man and a woman together, but as long as they were performing their heteronormative roles, that appeared to pass muster.) Figure skating was the very <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-olympic-sport-in-one-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first “winter” sport</a> added to the Olympic program at a time when there was not yet a separate event for winter sports.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The creation of the ladies category, however, didn’t relegate the women to second-class status as it did in many other sports — even if for many years, the winner of the women’s category wasn’t technically considered a world champion. “The ladies did the same compulsory figures as the men, and because there were no required elements in free skating, program content was neither dictated nor limited by gender,” James R. Hines wrote in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Skating-Formative-Years-Expanding/dp/0252039068/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2EHKGM0J8HCZX&amp;keywords=figure+skating&amp;qid=1641939240&amp;rnid=283155&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=figure+skating%2Cstripbooks%2C316&amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figure Skating in the Formative Years: Singles, Pairs, and the Expanding Role of Women</a>.” He noted that the only thing that held the women back technically in those days was their traditionally feminine and modest attire. They had nothing to lose but their long skirts. </p>

In subjectively judged aesthetic sports like figure skating and gymnastics, athletes aren’t simply performing the most difficult elements they can pull off with the best possible technique they can manage; they’re often enacting traditional ideas about masculinity and femininity. With gymnastics, this divide is quite stark: The men and women ended up with completely different apparatuses, with only minor overlap (floor, vault) between them. With figure skating, since the men and women are doing the same elements on the very same ice, things like costuming, music choice and choreography became the way the distinctions between male and female, masculine and feminine are made. And just as the meanings of masculinity and femininity have shifted over time, so too have the figure skating performances meant to evince those qualities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past century, men’s and women’s skating have diverged, converged, diverged and then converged again. The dividing line placed between the two disciplines was never a brick wall but a porous membrane that has allowed one discipline to influence the other. But given the prominence of women’s figure skating, particularly in the West, it has been the women — shunted off to their own category at the turn of the 20th century — who have helped shape the popular image of the sport. </p>

She looks like a real woman on the ice,” Baiul told Katarina Witt, the 1984 and 1988 Olympic champion. “We must skate as women on the ice.” Baiul, who would win that competition at only 15 years old and then win gold a year later at the Lillehammer Olympics, was likely emphasizing “woman” because she herself was so young, and Trenary’s style, which exemplified an adult femininity, was clearly something she aspired to in her performances. Typically in sports, doing anything like “a girl” — running, throwing, punching, breathing — is suggestive of doing a sport in a less than ideal way because the ideal way is the “masculine” way, whatever that means. This is not the case for women’s figure skating. Skating as a “woman,” whatever that means at a particular point in time, is part of a job. And for years, the task of the men was to look at their female counterparts and make sure that their skating was markedly different.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The difference between the men’s and women’s approaches to figure skating was particularly evident in the performances at the 1968 Olympics, when American Peggy Fleming won the gold. On the men’s side, Tim Wood from the U.S. took second with a very different kind of performance. Where Fleming was balletic and feminine, with her arms raised above her head, rounded and soft, Wood’s arms never went above shoulder height; they were stiff like the blades of a propeller. His upper body was mostly rigid; all the movement was coming from his feet, while Fleming showed off her flexibility, arching her back in a layback spin and extending her leg upward in a spiral. And then there were the costumes. Wood was dressed in conventional blue, his costume unadorned. Fleming was wearing a chartreuse skating dress, also unbaubled — this was before skating’s bedazzled era began. (Fleming noted that <a href="https://olympics.com/en/featured-news/peggy-fleming-1968-grenoble-artistry-figure-skating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her mother chose this color</a> because she thought it would endear the 19-year-old skater to the French audience in Grenoble, as it referenced the French liqueur by the same name.) While both Fleming and Wood did many of the same elements, save for the triple jumps that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-quad-jump-revolution-has-transformed-womens-figure-skating-how-far-will-it-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weren’t yet part</a> of the average woman’s skating program, they performed them and the choreography around them in a distinctly gendered way.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1484" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-FlemingWoods.jpg" alt="Peggy Fleming, Tim Wood" class="wp-image-325265" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-FlemingWoods.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-FlemingWoods.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-FlemingWoods.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-FlemingWoods.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-FlemingWoods.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Americans Peggy Fleming and Tim Wood performed many of the same moves in 1968, but their choreography and costumes were distinctly gendered. <p class="photo-credit credits">BETTMAN / Disney General Entertainment Content / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Wood’s style on the ice was not unusual for male skaters of this period. In fact, it was quite typical. In “Artistic Impressions: Figure Skating, Masculinity and the Limits of Sport,” Mary Louise Adams wrote that the style that had come to typify men’s skating in the postwar period was a deliberate attempt by athlete and official alike to counter the feminine associations the sport had accrued, especially after the long reign of Norway’s Sonja Henie, who became the most recognizable skater in the world after her three Olympic golds and her successful foray into Hollywood films. “They tried to fashion for <em>men’s</em> skating a new identity as an athletically demanding, clearly defined sport,” Adams wrote of the men’s skating style that emerged in the 1940s and ’50s. It was during this time that American Dick Button, the <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/84513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1948 and 1952 Olympic gold medalist</a>, performed the first double axel jump in competition, as well as the first triple toe loop. There was beauty in the men’s skating, to be sure, but it was the kind of beauty borne of deep edges and perfectly held upright carriages. It’s the beauty of technique but not of feeling and expression.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But by the mid-’70s, this rigid style of performance was changing, largely due to the efforts of John Curry of Great Britain and Toller Cranston of Canada — the 1976 Olympic <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/results/13362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold and bronze medalists</a>, respectively.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Curry brought a classical ballet mien to his programs. He used his arms fully to express the music and extended his legs. Initially quite weak at figures — which while not as important in 1973, was still part of the final score — he worked with school figures master Carlo Fassi, who had coached Fleming and Dorothy Hamill to Olympic gold medals. To tackle his weakness as a jumper, he worked with Gus Lussi. By 1976, he was the best at the world championships and Olympics. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1484" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-Curry-Cranston.jpg" alt="John Curry, Toller Cranston" class="wp-image-325264" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-Curry-Cranston.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-Curry-Cranston.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-Curry-Cranston.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-Curry-Cranston.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GENDERED_SKATING-Curry-Cranston.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>In the 1970s, skaters John Curry, left, and Toller Cranston focused on expressing the music of their programs with their bodies. <p class="photo-credit credits">BETTMAN / Boris Spremo / Toronto Star / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Cranston, his Canadian competitor, took things further. Unable to overcome his weakness in the figures, Cranston never won the major international titles that Curry did despite occasionally besting the Brit in the free skate. He hit more unusual shapes than Curry did, and he performed skills like layback spins that demanded greater flexibility, which were typically seen as the domain of the women skaters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They understood their music, they attended to the fine details of body line, and they certainly did not allow prevailing notions of masculinity to curtail their creativity,” Adams wrote of Curry and Cranston. “As a consequence, they both struggled throughout their careers to gain acceptance in a sport that had grown aesthetically timid in the face of narrow but popular ideas of how male bodies should move and perform in public.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Tollerance-Intimate-Revolutionized-Skating/dp/0771023340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Tollerance: An Intimate Memoir by the Man Who Revolutionized Figure Skating</a>,” Cranston spoke of the resistance he had encountered when he brought his baroque style to the ice. “In the days when men dressed up as maître d’s, skated their long programs in shirts, ties, and tiny matador jackets, and were not allowed to raise their hands above their shoulders, I was a renegade,” he wrote. “I invented beads on men’s costumes. I invented décolleté. Everything I did was new, different, and shocking to the Old Guard, and I was punished for it.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg" alt="The men’s medalists in 1976" class="wp-image-325263" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The men’s medalists in 1976, from left: Vladimir Kovalyov of the USSR, who won silver; John Curry of Great Britain, gold; and Toller Cranston of Canada, bronze. <p class="photo-credit credits">AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">While he and Curry were able to win medals — in Curry’s case more than a few — this didn’t stop those in the skating community from signaling their displeasure with the male skaters’ style. As Adams recounted, “In the days before computerized marking, Curry faced judges who, in protest against his style, refused to lift their scorecards higher than their shoulders.” I guess the men weren’t supposed to raise their arms above shoulder height on the ice or off. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s very clear that the resistance to Curry and Cranston’s on-ice style was due to their perceived violation of gender norms. Said one TV announcer when talking about Ron Shaver, a Canadian teammate of Cranston’s: “Now we will see more of a male performance.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams cited a German writer who wrote this about the two in a book recapping the 1976 Winter Olympics: “If either the handsome Toller or the graceful John had worn a small skirt they could have become the best female skater of this year’s winter games. … Never before have men skated so femininely.” What this writer is pointedly saying is that there is functionally no difference between the performances of the women and those of Curry and Cranston other than costuming. And what they’re acknowledging is that the distinction between men’s and women’s skating is largely a performative one, not an athletic one. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In most sports, the direction of influence goes from the men to the women, not the other way around. The men are viewed as the innovators in athletic disciplines, with women, who were often not allowed to participate until well after the sport had established itself, playing what feels like an eternal game of catch-up. But in figure skating, women have been there from the earliest days; many old paintings of skating feature women on ice, often skating together with men. While there was resistance to women’s participation in a head-to-head style of competition against men — see: Syers, Madge — women have been around skating as long as their male counterparts. You can put them into a separate category, but their influence will still be felt, just as the influence of the men can be seen in the women’s programs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And male skaters like Cranston felt quite comfortable acknowledging the contributions of female skaters. In the 1975 book “Toller” by Elva Oglanby, Cranston is quite effusive in his praise of U.S. figure skater Janet Lynn, who was considered the best free skater of the time despite having never won a world or Olympic title. (Like Cranston, Lynn was a weak school figures skater.) “She has a quality about her that almost defies description. There is something almost mystical in the way she moves, the flow of her hair, the delicate motion of her arms, the dream-like fluidity. She is a beautiful wraith. … I sincerely believe that Janet Lynn is the greatest female skater the world has ever seen,” Cranston said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Curry’s and Cranston’s impact on the sport was almost immediate. In his commentary over American Scott Cramer’s 1977 long program at the U.S. national championships, Dick Button acknowledges that. “He’s a young man who’s changed his style completely very recently. He’s much influenced by Toller Cranston now. He’s loosened up his style of performing,” Button said. “I think it’s rather refreshing to see some of the freedom that has come into the sport of figure skating as a result of recent years.” In the opening moments of his long program, Cramer lifts his arms above his head, a small but significant sign that men’s figure skating had changed. </p>

Cranston wrote about how he was the one to bring beads to men’s skating costumes, but he wasn’t really the person to get the sparkle trend in figure skating going. “In a disco-fied era that became as known for its glitter and sparkle as it was for its music, the rhinestones and beads that adorned many a nightlife outfit soon found their way to skating costumes,” Kelli Lawrence wrote in “Skating on Air: The Broadcast History of an Olympic Marquee Sport.” “[Linda] Fratianne is often considered the one who sparkled first, and quite literally, sparkled brightest.” Fratianne burst onto the scene with her sparkles (and her triple jumps), and though she didn’t medal in Innsbruck — Hamill took the gold there — by the time the 1977 world championships rolled around, she was the best in the world. And soon, everyone else was going HAM with the bedazzler too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Naturally, there was a backlash to this trend, particularly for the men. Scott Hamilton, before he became a four-time world champion and 1984 Olympic gold medalist, asked a reporter at a 1982 world championships press conference, “When are you guys going to start treating us like athletes?” The reporter responded, “When you guys stop dressing like Liberace!” It seemed that the reporter’s primary gripe with male skaters wasn’t about what they did on the ice, be it athletic or artistic, but about how they looked. The journalist was defining “sport” on the basis of appearance. (It’s also hard to miss the homophobia in the reporter’s comment.) After that, Hamilton started wearing what were essentially speedskating suits. “The professionals emphasize the artistic side of figure skating, and that’s fine. But as long as we’re an Olympic sport, I think the emphasis in the amateur ranks should be on the athletic side,” Hamilton said. He seems to be drawing the line between art and sport with attire, not with style of movement, as had been the concern of critics of Curry and Cranston in the ’70s, or of music choice. </p>

Nancy Kerrigan was generally talked about in terms of her bearing and appearance — she wore beautiful, elegant skating outfits designed by Vera Wang. But Kerrigan was actually an athletic skater. She was competing triple-triple jump combinations well before they had become the norm in women’s figure skating — just in a really nice dress. Unlike for the men, this image helped Kerrigan with sponsors and the general public. The evolution of women’s skating costumes has enabled greater athleticism while still coding them as feminine, which made their athletic feats “acceptable.” The same thing happened for the men — the costumes obscured the skaters’ athleticism — but this was not viewed as a desirable outcome for the male skaters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The anxiety over masculinity that was still palpable in the ’80s and ’90s appears to have subsided considerably today. Some men skate in simple, relatively unadorned outfits; others prefer a tad more sparkle or flash. These sartorial preferences are far less remarked upon than they once had been. This feels a bit like progress. But the tension over the gendered lines of figure skating remains. You can see that from the reaction to Canadian male singles skater Keegan Messing wearing white boots in practice at the recent Canadian national championships. Since the late 1920s, women have worn white boots, following in the great Sonja Henie’s bootsteps. Up until then, both men and women wore black boots. (Henie, upon realizing that all the women had copied her style, started wearing beige boots.) The reaction to Messing’s choice wasn’t negative, but the fact that a man wearing a white boot on the ice was even a little noteworthy shows how these superficial distinctions between men’s and women’s skating still matter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1366" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg" alt="Jason Brown" class="wp-image-325273" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Men’s skaters like Jason Brown are emphasizing the artistic elements that had been associated more with women’s skating. <p class="photo-credit credits">Jean Catuffe / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As the technical gap between men’s and women’s skating continues to narrow, very minor aesthetic differences are all that remain to distinguish the men’s event from the women’s. At these Games, Russian Kamila Valieva became the first female skater to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hda3vvmqQHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perform a quad jump</a> in Olympic competition — though that accomplishment has been complicated by the reports that she <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/33256776/olympics-2022-know-russian-figure-skater-kamila-valieva-alleged-positive-drug-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive</a> for a banned substance, putting her Olympics in jeopardy.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="21" href="#fn-21" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the recent &lt;a href="https://results.isu.org/events/gprus2021_Women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rostelecom Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Valieva outscored the men’s winner even though she was barred from doing quads in her short program; if she had been allowed to add a quad jump to her short program, her overall point total could have been even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-21">21</sup></a> While the men are still ahead of the women in jumps, the women are gaining ground, and given that upgrading to quintuple jumps seems essentially impossible — with the structural limits of boots, blades and the human body — it’s only a matter of time until the women pull up alongside men in this regard. And on the artistic side of the sport, the men have pulled in line with women already; men like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/jason-brown-may-not-land-a-quad-jump-in-beijing-his-fans-dont-need-him-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Jason Brown</a> are performing gorgeous spirals reminiscent of Kerrigan’s iconic pose in the ’90s and Sasha Cohen’s extension and flexibility in the early aughts. Men’s step sequences are every inch as intricate and expressive as those of the women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But still, despite this seeming convergence, men and women compete in separate categories, unless they’re competing in pairs or ice dance, in which case they’re generally tasked with enacting <a href="https://deadspin.com/what-makes-ice-dancing-different-brother-sister-pairs-1823041001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heteronormative ideals</a> (with the exception of the <a href="https://time.com/5155292/maia-alex-shibutani-skating-siblings-olympics-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibutani siblings</a>). What it means to be a man or a woman on the ice might have shifted to some degree, but you still have to be one or the other, which leaves skaters like Timothy LeDuc, a pairs skater representing the U.S., in quite a bind: LeDuc <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/02/04/openly-nonbinary-athlete-timothy-leduc-iowa-figure-skating-winter-olympics-2022-history/9291432002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out publicly as nonbinary</a> last year, but they still have to perform the male partner’s elements on ice, which means doing the lifts and throws. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cranston wrote about the tension of gendered movement in his memoir: “I was uninhibited in a day when lack of inhibition was virtually unknown; uninhibited in interpretation, original moves, and body language — which I felt was inherently neither male nor female.” Cranston saw his performance on the ice as almost genderless; he was simply an expressive being. It was the viewers who decided to gender the moves he did with his body as female, and then to perceive him as being in violation of norms, the same way that ISU officials, over half a century before Cranston took to Olympic ice, looked at moves Syers did and decided that they, too, were inappropriate for a woman. In his case, it was the manner of expression, and in hers, it was the context of the movement — in direct competition with men. The failures weren’t theirs but ours — of being unable to imagine any other world might be possible, if only through sport. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">How to go about building a Super Bowl team? That’s the question 32 front offices ask themselves every NFL offseason — and almost all of them land on the incorrect answer, for one reason or another. The two clubs that get it right, meanwhile, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-more-than-one-way-to-build-a-super-bowl-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually offer variations on a theme</a> for the rest of the league to copy. But we may never have seen two teams <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cincinnati-bengals-los-angeles-rams-super-bowl-11644129467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take such radically different paths</a> to Super Bowl Sunday — or offer such different lessons in how to reach the cusp of a championship — as the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams this season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that variety is a good thing for football. A <a href="https://twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1391827053868105739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common refrain from other sports</a> is that they’ve become too homogenized in their dominant strategies, whether it involves the rise of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/idioms/three-true-outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three true outcome</a>-based rosters in baseball or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mapping-shots-in-the-nba-changed-it-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-point-shooting teams</a> in basketball. The NFL has its own <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33253649/commissioner-roger-goodell-says-nfl-fell-short-hiring-minority-head-coaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive homogeneity problems</a>, to be sure, but there’s less to complain about when it comes to teams all building the same way. Cincinnati and L.A. are the only two teams whose championship hopes have not yet been dashed, but how they got here is a study in contrasts.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Cincinnati’s rise this season was meteoric. Though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-2021-nfl-projections-like-the-bucs-and-chiefs-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we called the Bengals</a> “an intriguing pick to improve greatly” in our NFL preview, they also started out ranked just 27th in our preseason <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elo ratings</a>, with only a 1 percent chance to win the Super Bowl. Only one eventual Super Bowl team — the 1999 “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/revisiting-the-greatest-show-on-turf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greatest Show on Turf</a>” (St. Louis) Rams — ever began a season ranked lower in Elo than Cincy did this year:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By Week 7, when the Bengals <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202110240rav.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demolished the Ravens 41-17</a> in Baltimore, it was becoming clear that Cincinnati had the potential to vastly exceed its meager preseason expectations. But after rising to No. 12 in Elo with that victory, Cincy hit a snag — losing four of its next six contests to drop back down to No. 22 in Elo. That’s when the Bengals went on another tear, winning six of seven to close the regular season and begin the playoffs — the lone blemish being a start by backup quarterback Brandon Allen <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201090cle.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Week 18</a>. After an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-finally-have-a-super-bowl-matchup-and-its-exactly-what-we-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressive upset comeback</a> against the Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati now ranks seventh in Elo, a 20-slot improvement on its Week 1 ranking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Bengals’ journey is a testament to the power of building with young talent through the draft. The team took <a href="http://pfref.com/pi/share/bptXt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four of its five best offensive players</a> this season by <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/approximate-value-methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Approximate Value</a> (AV) — QB Joe Burrow (15 AV), receivers Ja’Marr Chase (13) and Tee Higgins (10) and lineman Jonah Williams (9) — with picks in the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/draft.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 33 slots of each of the past three drafts</a>. Expanding the scope of things slightly, nearly 75 percent of the Bengals’ total yards from scrimmage this season were gained by players Cincinnati selected over the past five drafts (a list that includes <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/2021.htm#rushing_and_receiving::7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading rusher Joe Mixon</a> as well). That’s a perfect recipe for a great young core, if not necessarily an experienced one. In terms of average age and previous career AV — weighted by the amount of AV each player produced during the season itself — the Bengals have both the youngest and the least-established roster of any team in Super Bowl history:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That youth could serve the Bengals well for a while; a number of clubs on that list went on to contend beyond just their initial Super Bowl run. Win or lose, Cincinnati could be set up for lasting success based on the youth movement that has helped it reach this Super Bowl.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the success of the Bengals’ young stars this year ended up being key to their master rebuilding plan. Because so many of the team’s best offensive players make comparatively little money — Burrow, Chase, Higgins and Williams <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cincinnati-bengals/contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earn a combined average annual value</a> (AAV) of $23.3 million, or just under 13 percent <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-2021-salary-cap-182-5-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the salary cap</a>, while producing nearly 21 percent of the team’s AV — Cincinnati could maintain one of the league’s <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/#passing::21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most efficient passing offenses</a> despite committing the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2021/offense/active-aav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12th-fewest dollars of AAV to offense</a> of any team. In turn, that enabled Cincinnati to increase its spending on defense from the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2020/defense/active-aav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-fewest AAV dollars</a> in 2020 to the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2021/defense/active-aav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th-most in 2021</a>, and see its defensive performance improve from No. 25 in schedule-adjusted <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/8379024/nfl-explaining-expected-points-metric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected points added (EPA)</a> per game to No. 11. All of that, combined with the stellar play of its special teams corps (No. 3 in EPA), added up to make Cincinnati an unlikely — but far from illogical — AFC champion.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, the Rams took a completely opposite path to the Super Bowl. If little had been expected of Cincinnati coming into 2021, Los Angeles’s expectations were sky-high — pressure ratcheted up further by the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/matthew-stafford-gave-the-rams-a-shot-at-a-title-the-rams-gave-stafford-a-shot-at-canton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offseason acquisition of QB Matthew Stafford</a> to help push a star-studded roster over the top. L.A. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked sixth in Elo</a> before the season, and it mostly played to that form all year long: After starting off like a team on a mission, winning seven of their first eight contests, the Rams suffered their only losing streak of the year at midseason but recovered by winning eight of nine across the end of the regular season and into the playoffs. Along the way, the Rams <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201230tam.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knocked out</a> the defending-champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-brady-retires-with-all-the-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ending Tom Brady’s career</a> — and even <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201300ram.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanquished their rival San Francisco 49ers</a>, who had beaten them twice during the regular season and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-to-watch-for-in-the-nfls-conference-championships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to pose the biggest matchup challenge</a> to L.A.’s preferred style of play.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in stark contrast with the Bengals’ plan to build around highly drafted young talent, the Rams have famously <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-love-trading-early-draft-picks-how-much-value-do-they-find-in-the-later-rounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eschewed high draft picks</a> with a focus instead on building around established big names and hunting for late-round bargains. While Los Angeles’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-bengals-slow-down-aaron-donald-nothings-stopped-him-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most important player</a> — defensive lineman Aaron Donald — was selected by the Rams <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2014_draft.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a first-round pick</a> in 2014, essentially <a href="http://pfref.com/pi/share/VxGT4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none of L.A.’s other contributors</a> were taken by the team with a high pick. To the extent the Rams have any highly drafted players, they are stars like Stafford, cornerback Jalen Ramsey, linebackers Von Miller and Leonard Floyd and receiver Odell Beckham Jr. — all of whom were drafted by <em>other</em> teams and joined the Rams later.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That has helped give Los Angeles one of the least-homegrown cast of characters to ever reach a Super Bowl, with 40.8 percent of the team’s total AV coming from players who did not make their NFL debuts as Rams. While not quite as extreme as a team like the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/2002.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2002 Oakland Raiders</a> — for whom a stunning 56.3 percent of AV came from players drafted outside the organization — the Rams’ number still ranks them 13th out of the 112 teams in Super Bowl history, well above the all-time Super Bowl average of 25 percent for non-homegrown production.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="22" href="#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a far cry from the days of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/pit/1979.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1979 Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, who somehow received 100 percent of their production from homegrown players &mdash; which still makes them the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-nov-22-x4512&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;only entirely homegrown roster&lt;/a&gt; in Super Bowl history (a distinction they will likely always carry, as player movement is far greater in the NFL today than it was then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-22">22</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The strategy has also brought plenty of roster churn since the last time the Rams were on the championship stage, even though it’s been only four seasons since Los Angeles <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-really-made-a-mess-of-super-bowl-liii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell to the New England Patriots</a> in Super Bowl LIII. Compared with that team, L.A. in 2021 has a brand-new leading passer (Stafford instead of Jared Goff), leading rusher (Sony Michel, who was actually on the Patriots in 2018, instead of Todd Gurley), leading tackler (safety Jordan Fuller — who <a href="https://twitter.com/JourdanRodrigue/status/1480692266909847554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a season-ending injury</a> in Week 18 — instead of linebacker Cory Littleton) and only six total starters in common.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="23" href="#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining &ldquo;starter&rdquo; as a player who started at least eight games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-23">23</sup></a> Overall, this year’s Rams roster received only 33.9 percent of its AV from players who had been on the 2018 Super Bowl team — so tear up your programs from February 2019 if you’re looking for a who’s who of L.A. stars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Los Angeles has impressively executed its grand, unconventional team-building strategy. The Rams have found <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2021_roster.htm#roster::5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of starters</a> with picks in the second round or later — headlined by the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2017/draft.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 third-round selection</a> of <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/allpro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All-Pro wideout</a> Cooper Kupp, who just hauled in the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_single_season.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-most receiving yards in a single season</a> in NFL history. They also hit on most of their “<a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/bob-glauber/super-bowl-rams-bengals-1.50500466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mercenary</a>” veteran acquisitions, with Stafford, Miller, Ramsey, Floyd and Beckham all playing significant roles in the team’s postseason run.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="24" href="#fn-24" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each has played at least 72 percent of available snaps in the playoffs on their side of the ball, according to ESPN&rsquo;s Stats &amp;amp; Information Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-24">24</sup></a> The resulting group has a top-heavy quality; six Rams <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/los-angeles-rams/contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a higher contract AAV</a> than Cincinnati’s <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cincinnati-bengals/contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest-paid player</a> (defensive end Trey Hendrickson at $15 million), but L.A. also has only five players making between $2 million and $15 million. (Cincinnati has 14.) While it’s not quite a full <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/paine-out-of-sample-war.png?w=610" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“stars-and-scrubs” model</a> of putting together a team, because L.A. has scrounged for genuine contributors up and down the roster, it’s a very different type of club than the one lining up on the opposite sideline Sunday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the radically different paths each team took to get here, the Bengals and Rams did both end up in the same place. Along the way, they proved once again that there is no shortage of approaches that can lead you to winning football games.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Almost four years ago, <a href="https://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2018/02/22/team-usa-womens-hockey-gold-medal-victory-is-most-watched-late-night-show-in-nbcsn-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.7 million people</a> watched a hockey game on NBC that ended after 2 a.m. Eastern, bringing an end to a drought that had spanned two decades. The U.S. women’s national team had, on the Olympic stage, finally overcome its rivals to the north for the first time in these players’ careers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The victory over Canada was a blockbuster moment for the U.S., but those gold medals with the five rings on them tell only a fraction of the story in what is one of the most bitter rivalries in women’s sports. And they leave out crucial stories of the growth of the game outside North America: the tale of Finland’s rise and Sweden’s swift fall, of a young Czech team that has the potential to stand toe to toe with giants. We’ve seen these stories again on display over the course of this Olympic tournament in Beijing, with the quarterfinals <a href="https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/ice-hockey/event-schedule-women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting late Thursday</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The past three decades of women’s hockey is full of all the drama of a young sport on the rise, both on the ice and off. It features boycotts and contract negotiations, new opportunities and sudden collapses — and yes, gritty battles between the U.S. and Canadian teams.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From the moment women’s hockey burst onto the international scene in 1990 — in front of 9,000 fans at the inaugural world championships held in Ottawa, Canada — there was an obvious and stark disparity in skill level between the North American teams and their counterparts from the rest of the world. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/sports/hockey/23hockey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Future Hockey Hall of Famers</a> such as Canada’s Angela James and the U.S.’s Cammi Granato led their teams in dominating many of their overmatched competitors. This gap would remain something of an abyss over the following nine years, with Canada emerging into the new decade with a +168 goal differential in just 26 international games played (across world championships and Olympics). The only other teams to end the 1990s with a positive number in the goal differential column were the United States (+140) and Finland (+106).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can also use a more advanced, all-in-one metric to show the highs and lows of the sport. <a href="https://twitter.com/DigDeepBSB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Murphy</a> created a women’s college hockey version of <a href="https://hockey-graphs.com/2020/06/25/examining-player-development-in-ncaa-di-womens-hockey-with-game-score-pt-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game score</a>; our version, adapted for international play and limited by the data available, pares his version down somewhat, using goals, assists, shots on goal<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="25" href="#fn-25" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shots on goal data isn’t available until 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-25">25</sup></a> and penalty infraction minutes. A country’s game score is the sum of individual player game scores.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Using Game Score to track the quality of the teams from 1990 on, what we see in that first decade is Canada and the U.S. locked in battle from the beginning, with Finland running a close third. Canada bested the U.S. in <a href="https://www.eurohockey.com/league/915-world-womens-championship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all five world championships</a> held in the 1990s, but the U.S. did claim the <a href="https://teamusa.usahockey.com/page/show/2908052-1998-nagano-olympic-winter-games-women-s-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaugural Olympic gold</a> in 1998 at Nagano.</p>

These leagues, while not professional leagues, provided female players with a competitive space to play post-college. Similarly, across the Atlantic, 2007 saw the establishment of the Swedish Women’s Hockey League, or Riksserien, as it was then known. With the world’s second-best league in the world in Scandinavia, and those nations’ elite talent able to compete against one another on a regular basis, nations like Finland and Sweden became increasingly competitive on the international stage. With Finland already putting pressure on them, and Sweden seemingly rapidly catching up, it was a make-or-break time for the USA and Canada with elite players on all four teams going head to head. The major difference was in large part due to the depth of North American rosters and their ability to draw on younger elite players than the Scandinavian nations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The development of young hockey players also gained a major push this decade when the NCAA national women’s hockey championships became an officially sanctioned event. (The first unofficial national collegiate championship <a href="https://www.powerplays.news/p/the-astonishing-story-behind-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took place in 1998</a> and was financed by the United States Olympic Committee in the lead-up to Nagano.) The NCAA women’s hockey program would go on to become the proving ground for many elite female players over the course of the decade: Angela Ruggerio, Jennifer Botterill, Julie Chu and Jessie Vetter — some of the greatest female players to ever play on international ice — were among the winners of the Patty Kazmaier Award, bestowed on the top female player in college hockey each year. The national championship provided the vast majority of North American players with something that simply didn’t exist in Europe or Asia — with the full weight of Title IX aiding these players in their development.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With more playing opportunities and greater development, the skill level in Canada and the U.S. kept rising — borne out by the intense matchups between the two countries. Canada continued its dominance for the first three world championships of the new millennium, though the U.S. bounced back to win three of the final four of the 2000s. In the Olympics, though, Canada rebounded from defeat at Nagano to take the 2002 and 2006 golds — and in Turin, the U.S. didn’t even make the gold-medal game, <a href="https://teamusa.usahockey.com/page/show/2908084-2006-torino-olympic-winter-games-women-s-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling to silver medalist Sweden</a>.</p>

It was during this time that the second iteration of the National Women’s Hockey League (now the Premier Hockey Federation) was founded and became <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nwhl-first-paid-womens-pro-hockey-league-drops-puck-on-first-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first league to officially pay female players</a> in any capacity before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/sports/hockey/womens-hockey-league-will-pay-players-for-first-time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Canadian</a> and Swedish leagues followed suit in subsequent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With increased visibility came increased opportunities for women in the post-collegiate sphere to continue playing longer, with additional support at both a national and team level. But this decade also saw some of the greatest unrest in women’s hockey, with <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/19026627/usa-hockey-us-women-national-team-reach-agreement-avoid-boycott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boycotts by both the USA</a> and <a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/08/16/swedish-womens-hockey-players-boycott-over-pay-dispute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish national teams</a> over player compensation, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/sports/cwhl-womens-hockey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shock folding of Canada’s CWHL</a> and the <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/womens-hockey-players-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#forthegame movement</a> in North America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The decade also brought about some of the sport’s most memorable highlights: the Canadian win on home ice during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics; the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqBHav5puKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ping Heard Round the World</a>” in the 2014 Olympic gold medal game, when the USA missed an empty-net goal, hitting the post instead, with just over a minute left. (Canada would go on to equalize 30 seconds later and then win in OT.) The USWNT won the 2017 world championships in overtime just days after reaching an agreement with U.S. Hockey, and then the team won gold for the first time in 20 years at the Pyeongchang Olympics on the anniversary of Miracle on Ice. And that’s not to forget Finland taking silver for the first time in history at the 2019 world championships (though <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/iihf-explains-why-the-goal-that-cost-finland-gold-was-disallowed-1.4380760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many may argue</a> that it <a href="https://www.theicegarden.com/2019/4/14/18310629/2019-womens-world-championship-iihf-controversy-finland-usa-gold-medal-game-goalie-interference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should have been gold</a>).</p>

Canada would take home the gold, making up for its first bronze medal in history during the 2019 event and placing the team in an excellent position heading into Beijing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The under-18 women’s worlds has now been <a href="https://nhl.nbcsports.com/2021/12/24/iihf-cancels-u18-womens-championship-for-2nd-straight-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled two years in a row</a>, but the future of women’s hockey remains bright. Two years’ worth of rookies entering the U.S. and Canadian national systems together have introduced several exciting young stars, some of whom are sure to wear their national flag for at least the remainder of this decade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even at this early stage, we have already seen some players’ careers ignite. Sarah Fillier’s performance for Canada at the 2021 world championship shot her toward being a household name. At the same tournament, Grace Zumwinkle stepped out and shone, even among a star-studded U.S. lineup. And Dominika Lásková, who plays for Merrimack College in the NCAA, showed up big for the Czech Republic and was a key contributor to their offensive dominance, <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/hockey/story/_/id/32085764/dominika-laskova-scores-twice-czech-republic-beats-germany-win-group-b-women-hockey-worlds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scoring four goals as a defender</a> — something her team will be hoping continues in Beijing. Finland, which is the biggest threat to the U.S. and Canada’s hold on the gold-medal game, saw goaltender Anni Keisala step up big at the worlds, all but cementing her position as the team’s starting goaltender and last line of defense. In the U.S. and Canada’s group play matchup in Beijing, Abby Roque emerged as a force for Team USA with an almost perfect faceoff record against the Canadians, and while she is still goal-less in the tournament, it feels like only a matter of time. Similarly, Fillier continues to defy even the loftiest of expectations, scoring on her opening shift in two straight games. And if the two teams, entering the semifinals seeded first and second, meet again in the Olympics, it will be in the gold-medal game. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Olympics still stands taller than any other international tournament as the ultimate measure of not just a player’s skill but a country’s might — and for the first time in history, it might not be just a two-horse race this winter. While their lineups may be made of Titans of the Sport in players like Marie-Philip Poulin, Mélodie Daoust, Hilary Knight and Kendall Coyne Schofield, Canada and the United States are not invincible, and they can be beaten — Finland’s near-win in 2019 showed that. Other countries now boast stars comparable to those in North America: Finland has arguably the best defender in the world in Jenni Hiirikoski; Alina Müller, who <a href="http://reports.iihf.hockey/Hydra/436/IHW400000_85B_22_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led the last Olympics in goals</a>, plays for Switzerland; Nana Fujimoto has the ability to completely lock down the goal crease for Japan, letting nothing past; and the Czech Republic might be the most fun team to watch.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There may never have been a better time to get invested in women’s hockey. This tournament houses a rivalry that runs deep into the hearts of two nations, that makes a gold-medal game that finishes after 2 a.m. worth staying up for in the eyes of millions. It’s a chance to experience moments that will no doubt go down in hockey’s rich history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-paragraph="main">Despite all the high-profile mercenaries the Los Angeles Rams acquired during their run to Super Bowl LVI, the single biggest difference-maker is one they drafted in 2014: Aaron Donald. He’s not just the best at what he does, he’s the most impactful individual defender on the planet — and the Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line might not be able to slow him down.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Donald’s credentials are impeccable. Aside from making the Pro Bowl in every one of his <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DonaAa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight professional seasons</a> and being named first-team All-Pro seven years running, he’s won AP Defensive Player of the Year <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/awards/ap-defensive-player-of-the-year.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three of the last four seasons</a>. His tape backs up all the hardware, too; Pro Football Focus graded him as its best pass-rushing defensive lineman, fourth-best run-stopping defensive lineman and No. 1 overall defensive player of 2021.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="26" href="#fn-26" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald was also Pro Football Focus&rsquo;s top-graded defender in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, among those with at least 20 percent of the league-maximum defensive snaps. In 2015, he finished second-highest, and his rookie year he tied for eighth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-26">26</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Donald doesn’t just pass the eye test, either. His 12.5 regular-season sacks tied for seventh-most in the NFL, and according to ESPN’s Stats &amp; Information Group, his 84 tackles from the defensive line ranked third. He ranked second among all front-seven defenders in pass rush win rate and tied for eighth in disrupted dropback rate.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="27" href="#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropback rate is the player&rsquo;s total of sacks, interceptions, batted passes and passes defensed, divided by opponent dropbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-27">27</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But ESPN’s Video Analysis Team saw Donald generate pressure on only 10.5 percent of his pass rushes​​, good for 22nd in the league.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="28" href="#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among players whose pass rushes are at least 10 times the number of their team&rsquo;s games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-28">28</sup></a> That’s just 0.1 percentage points more than new Ram Von Miller and 1 point less often than their teammate Leonard Floyd. If Donald is beating blockers more often than everyone but Dallas Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons, why is Parsons’s league-best pressure rate almost twice as high (18.3 percent)?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Teams put a lot more blockers in front of Donald.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“These guys triple-team [Donald],” <a href="https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2021/11/04/rams-von-miller-aaron-donald-cried-tears-joy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miller told reporters</a> in his introductory press conference. “I’ve been getting triple-teamed for the last 10 years. That’s six people right there. And we still got Leonard Floyd and all the other guys. So, it’s going to be fun.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Opponents aren’t <em>quite</em> committing six blockers to just Donald and Miller. But as an interior lineman, Donald gets double-teamed more often than ends — and far more than stand-up rushers like Parsons and Floyd. Only five defenders faced double-teams more often on pass-rush snaps than Donald, according to ESPN’s Stats &amp; Information Group. Yet nobody beat double-teams more often:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="Double-teams couldn&#039;t stop Aaron Donald" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-GpAEk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GpAEk/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="575"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Double-teaming Donald is necessary to slow him down, but it isn’t exactly sufficient. He beat solo blockers a league-high 34.2 percent of the time, and his win rate against double-teams was still a league-best 23.1 percent — the same as Haason Reddick’s eighth-ranked <em>overall</em> rate. As Miller implied, the interior threat presented by Donald limits how often opponents can put more than one body between any other Ram and their quarterback.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the Cowboys, Parsons was double-teamed on 21.4 percent of his pass rushes. But Miller faced two opponents on only 7.5 percent of his rushes for the Rams, and Floyd was double-teamed just 11.6 percent of the time. Because Donald was doubled on a whopping 64 percent of his pass-rush snaps, his wingmen on the edge each got to rush one-on-one about nine pass rushes out of 10 — and Donald got through the line more often than anyone but Parsons anyway. No wonder Los Angeles led the league in ESPN’s pass-rush win rate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a brutal matchup for the Bengals, who have one of the worst offensive lines in football. Their team pass-block win rate was third-lowest in the league this regular season. Pro Football Focus graded Cincinnati as the 25th-ranked pass-blocking team, with grades in the 50s (and below) for every regular contributor save left tackle Jonah Williams.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Center Trey Hopkins has been a recent bright spot, posting pass-protection grades above 70 in four of the past five games — including a 75.3 in the AFC championship game. He’s been asked more regularly to help out platooning right guards Jackson Carman and Hakeem Adeniji, whose pass-blocking grades have been a miserable 45.9 and 38.9, respectively. During this five-game run of good form for Hopkins, he’s blocked in tandem on 85.7 percent of Cincinnati’s dropbacks. That’s not only much higher than his regular-season rate of 81.4 percent, it’s higher than <em>any</em> NFL lineman’s regular-season double-team rate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it hasn’t done much good. Though Hopkins’s pass-block win rate over the last five games has improved to 95.8 percent, the Bengals’ team rate was still just 53.1 percent — which, had that been their regular-season number, would have only bumped them up from 30th to 29th. Cincinnati just doesn’t have anybody, or any combination of anybodies, who can keep Donald and company away from quarterback Joe Burrow for very long.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Los Angeles wins, three of its hired-gun Pro Bowlers — Matthew Stafford, Odell Beckham Jr. and Eric Weddle — would get their first Super Bowl rings.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="29" href="#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller already has one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-29">29</sup></a> But Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said the team is focused on delivering a title to the player who’s been here all this time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This building wants to win for Aaron Donald to create more mystique to his legacy and what he’s done,” <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/01/27/raheem-morris-we-want-to-win-for-aaron-donalds-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morris told the Associated Press</a>. “We want to win for Aaron Donald.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Donald might win it for them first.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The trade that brought quarterback Matthew Stafford <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-and-lions-both-got-what-they-wanted/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Los Angeles</a> last year was a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-and-matthew-stafford-have-each-leveled-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fresh start</a> for both player and team. The former No. 1 pick desperately <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30880411/matthew-stafford-says-trade-request-detroit-lions-was-hardest-conversation-ever-had-surprised-landed-los-angeles-rams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needed a change in scenery</a> after 12 years in Detroit, and the Rams desperately <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/30732512/los-angeles-rams-coach-sean-mcvay-vague-jared-goff-future-qb-everything-being-evaluated" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wanted an upgrade over Jared Goff</a> at QB. But Stafford and his new team were already running out of time: The Rams had <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2021/01/30/rams-set-to-go-seven-straight-years-without-a-first-round-draft-pick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">traded away numerous future draft picks</a> with a single-minded focus on <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/nov/05/week-by-week-the-la-rams-are-trading-away-their-future-and-they-dont-care" target="_blank" rel="noopener">winning right now</a>, while their new QB had just turned 33 — with <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/matthew-stafford-reveals-laundry-list-of-injuries-he-played-through-in-2020-this-past-year-was-bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of extra mileage</a> — days after the trade was announced. With so much riding on it this year, the Stafford Experiment in L.A. could not afford to fail.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Fortunately for the Rams, it didn’t — and now Stafford and company are a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rams-or-bengals-our-guide-to-super-bowl-lvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">win over the Cincinnati Bengals away</a> from making it into the ultimate success story. Along the way, Stafford may also have reshaped his entire legacy and even helped us learn something about the effect coaching systems can have on a new quarterback (and vice versa).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not as though Stafford’s Lions career had been a disappointment. Indeed, his pre-2021 career <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/approximate-value-methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Approximate Value (AV)</a> of 133 had already far exceeded the number <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150329222816/http://www.pro-football-reference.com/blog/?p=527" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we would expect from a No. 1 overall pick</a> (73). Back in 2011, the so-called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TUlZkfH758U" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Year of the Quarterback</a>, Stafford <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2011/leaders.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was front and center</a>, alongside future Hall of Famers Tom Brady and Drew Brees, as one of three passers with at least 5,000 yards, the first time any season <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=1&amp;order_by=year_id&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=5000&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_yds&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had ever seen such prolific passing</a>. (Stafford remains <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=1&amp;order_by=year_id&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;ccomp%5B1%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B1%5D=5000&amp;cstat%5B1%5D=pass_yds&amp;ccomp%5B2%5D=gt&amp;cval%5B2%5D=40&amp;cstat%5B2%5D=pass_td&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of just six QBs</a> to surpass 5,000 yards and 40 touchdown passes in a single season.) Over his career, Stafford was <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=combined&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=qb_w&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;team_id=det&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">easily the winningest quarterback</a> in the history of the Lions, one of the NFL’s <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/#teams_active::1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">oldest teams</a>, and the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/#all_teams_av_images" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-best player in franchise history</a> according to AV — trailing only the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0VGmQ4SvTY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incomparable Barry Sanders</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But although Stafford made the playoffs three times with Detroit — its <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/det/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only three postseason berths</a> this century — the team bowed out in the wild-card round each time. And despite playing with fellow stars such as <a href="https://theatlantavoice.com/hometown-hero-calvin-johnson-gets-enshrined-at-pro-football-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hall of Fame wide receiver</a> Calvin Johnson and dominating defensive lineman Ndamukong Suh for many of his Lions seasons, Stafford left Detroit with a losing record (74-90-1) and facing questions about whether his individual stats could foster team success. While the Lions’ defense was largely ineffective during Stafford’s seasons as a primary starter, allowing an average of 2.4 more points per game than the typical NFL team, the team’s offense was also surprisingly mediocre — scoring 0.3 fewer points per game than average over the same span.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That all changed with the Rams this season. Between the regular season and playoffs, Los Angeles is averaging 27.2 points per game, which ranks sixth in the league and is 4.2 points better than the NFL average. That was the best offensive output (relative to average) for a Stafford-led team since the Lions were +7.3 points per game in 2011, and just the second time after 2013 that a Stafford-led team scored more than the league average. Unsurprisingly, Stafford had one of his finest individual passing seasons as well. This was the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm#passing_advanced::12" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-best performance</a> of his 13-year career by adjusted net yards per attempt index, <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm#passing::31" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-best (in a tie)</a> by AV, third-best by <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/all-the-ways-that-tom-brady-is-footballs-goat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QB value over replacement</a>, <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/S/StafMa00.htm#passing::23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth-best</a> by Total Quarterback Rating and <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/player/22338/matthew-stafford" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth-best</a> by Football Outsiders’ <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/info/methods#DVOA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Defense-adjusted Value Over Average</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Perhaps most importantly, Stafford has provided important new elements to coach Sean McVay’s offense that Goff couldn’t last season. In 2020, Goff ranked just 33rd out of 35 qualified QBs in air yards per attempt, 26th in touchdowns per attempt, 26th in first downs per attempt, 22nd in yards per completion and 28th in the share of attempts going for positive air yards. This regular season, by contrast, Stafford ranked fifth in air yards per throw, second in TDs per throw, fifth in first downs per throw, third in yards per completion and fourth in the share of attempts with positive air yards. While Stafford wasn’t perfect in his Rams debut — he <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing.htm#passing::14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tied for the league lead in interceptions</a>, with a per-attempt pick rate (2.8 percent) slightly higher than Goff’s last year (2.4 percent) — he offset those risks with far greater rewards throwing downfield.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stafford also performed much better under pressure — both literal and metaphorical — which in turn affected how defenses responded to L.A.’s attack. In 2020, Goff had the NFL’s sixth-worst QBR under pressure and sixth-worst QBR against man-to-man defenses, which encouraged opponents to load up on extra pass-rushers without fear of repercussions. Last season, only five QBs faced more blitzes per dropback than Goff’s 32.2 percent rate. But since Stafford handled the heat better (he ranked 14th-best in QBR under pressure) and posed more of a threat to burn any defenders left exposed in coverage — he led the NFL in QBR against man-to-man this year — opponents backed off and blitzed him at the fifth-lowest rate (21.8 percent) of any qualified QB, which helped give McVay’s play designs more time and space in which to operate. Only four other QBs this season threw to receivers who were less tightly covered, as defined by the <a href="https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFL’s Next Gen Stats</a>, than Stafford did.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Stafford earned even more respect from the defense in big moments, as the Rams went from having the NFL’s 10th-worst fourth-quarter passer by QBR with Goff in 2020 to its No. 1 fourth-quarter passer with Stafford at the helm in 2021. All of these factors helped to elevate the Rams’ offense from 21st in schedule-adjusted <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/8379024/nfl-explaining-expected-points-metric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected points added</a> (EPA) per game — and 23rd in passing EPA, specifically — last season to sixth on offense (and fifth in passing) this year. When given the opportunity to better harness his skills and lead a winning attack, Stafford did not squander it.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Such second acts are rare for Super Bowl quarterbacks, historically speaking. The average QB making his first Super Bowl start has been 28.4 years old during the season in question,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="30" href="#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Age given as of Dec. 31 of that season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-30">30</sup></a> much younger than Stafford (who was 33 for most of this season and turned 34 on Monday). The average debut Super Bowl starter was also usually playing for his first NFL team (71 percent of first-time starters), or at least the team with whom he generated the majority of his career QB value over replacement (84 percent). But Stafford bucks all of those trends. He is one of just five quarterbacks to make their first Super Bowl start at age 30 or older, with a team for whom they generated less than half of their career value:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Most of the other names on that list had surprising success in the big game itself, which Stafford can hope to emulate Sunday. Of the winners, Doug Williams was on his second NFL team — and third pro team, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doug_Williams_(quarterback)#Oklahoma_/_Arizona_Outlaws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">if we count the USFL</a> — when he won as a Super Bowl rookie <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_XXII" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in 1988</a>, while Brad Johnson and Jim Plunkett were on NFL team Nos. 3 apiece at the time of their victories. Plunkett and Williams <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Bowl_Most_Valuable_Player_Award" target="_blank" rel="noopener">were each named MVP</a> for their efforts as well, providing a rich template for the type of journeyman success Stafford is aiming for against the Bengals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And if he and the Rams do pull off the win, it would do wonders for Stafford’s legacy. According to Pro-Football-Reference.com’s <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/2019/12/introducing-the-pfr-hof-monitor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hall of Fame monitor statistic</a>, which uses AV and many other measures to judge a player’s suitability for enshrinement in Canton, Stafford <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/hof/hofm_QB.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently ranks 41st among all-time quarterbacks</a> with a monitor score (58.4) — well below the average for QBs already in the Hall (109), in addition to trailing contemporaries such as Aaron Rodgers (174.8), Matt Ryan (102.6), Russell Wilson (80.3) and Cam Newton (70.5). A Super Bowl appearance <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/pfr-hof-monitor-methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will automatically boost</a> Stafford’s score some, but he could gain as many as 10 extra points for winning the game (and also thereby eradicating his penalty for never winning a championship). That still wouldn’t put Stafford in clear Hall of Fame territory, but it would elevate him from a tier alongside Drew Bledsoe, Donovan McNabb and Carson Palmer into the company of Joe Theismann, Boomer Esiason and HOFer Len Dawson — and ahead of Hall of Famers Jim Kelly and Troy Aikman.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cincinnati will have a word or two to say about how history views Stafford before Sunday’s contest is all said and done. Time and again this postseason, the young Bengals <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/rams-or-bengals-our-guide-to-super-bowl-lvi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have diagnosed</a> how opposing passers are finding success and adapted to stop it with suffocating second halves. Even Stafford’s fourth-quarter dominance might not be immune to Cincy’s defensive scheming. But if he is able to crack that code, Stafford will have delivered to the Rams exactly what they were envisioning when they traded for him: a championship-caliber quarterback performance in a season when failure — for both player and team — was not an option.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">When the Olympic men’s ice hockey tournament <a href="https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/ice-hockey/olympic-daily-schedule.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gets underway</a> Wednesday, it will look very different from what we were expecting just a handful of months ago.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Back in September, everyone was <a href="https://theathletic.com/2795154/2021/09/03/with-the-nhl-officially-going-to-beijing-olympics-who-will-make-the-mens-hockey-rosters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excited about seeing NHL players</a> on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_international_ice_hockey_competitions_featuring_NHL_players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international stage</a> again, after a <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/nhl-players-will-participate-in-2022-beijing-olympics/c-326072268" target="_blank" rel="noopener">deal that was struck</a> between the league, the players’ association and the International Ice Hockey Federation to carve out space in the schedule for the league’s best to compete in Beijing.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="31" href="#fn-31" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NHL players had been allowed to go to the Olympics every cycle from 1998 through 2014, but the league did not reach an agreement to participate at the PyeongChang Games &lt;a href="https://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/nhl-will-not-participate-2018-pyeongchang-olympic-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-31">31</sup></a> But the NHL left itself <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/32918026/sources-nhl-not-going-olympics-due-covid" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an opt-out clause</a> if COVID-19 outbreaks “materially impacted” the 2021-22 regular season — and that’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-omicron-has-reshaped-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exactly what happened</a> when the omicron variant <a href="https://media.nhl.com/public/news/15413" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tore through the league</a> in December. On Dec. 22, commissioner Gary Bettman <a href="https://www.prohockeyrumors.com/2021/12/nhl-officially-withdraws-from-olympic-participation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the NHL was pulling its players out of the Olympics, instead <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/33101977/nhl-reshuffles-schedule-amid-postponements-plans-end-regular-season-april" target="_blank" rel="noopener">using the gap in the schedule</a> to reshuffle games that had been postponed because of the virus.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The move <a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/12/29/nhl-players-olympics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left players frustrated</a> over dashed gold-medal dreams, and <a href="https://www.scmp.com/sport/china/article/3162144/beijing-2022-missing-winter-olympics-china-may-signal-end-nhl-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener">probably deepened</a> the <a href="https://puckprose.com/2016/09/17/world-cup-of-hockey-olympic-involvement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existing divide</a> between the NHL and international hockey. But it also completely unsettled the Olympic rosters for the presumed favorites — whose players predominate the NHL ranks. And in the process, it <a href="https://www.hockeyfeed.com/nhl-news/drastic-shift-in-the-odds-for-olympic-men-s-hockey-in-beijing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">radically shifted the odds</a> of who might win in Beijing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Team organizing committees <a href="https://www.tsn.ca/men-s-olympic-hockey-rosters-beijing-2022-1.1700835" target="_blank" rel="noopener">had not yet finalized their rosters</a> at the time of the NHL’s announcement, but there was plenty of speculation about who would fill out each team — and the star power for some countries was positively blinding. Our ESPN colleagues Kristen Shilton and Greg Wyshynski <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/insider/insider/story/_/id/32877203/predicting-2022-olympic-hockey-rosters-which-nhl-stars-make-teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener">picked hypothetical lineups</a> using NHL players, which we can use as a proxy for how much talent was lost when the NHL pulled out of the Games. For example, here’s the veritable All-Star team they picked for Canada, along with those players’ stats from the past three NHL seasons:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">At the other end of the spectrum, the Russian Olympic Committee was the clear winner of the NHL’s decision to pull out. After that announcement, the ROC’s odds soared by 18 percentage points to 32 percent — making it the favorite for gold over Finland (16 percent) and Sweden (14 percent), with Canada (11 percent), the Czech Republic (9 percent) and the U.S. (6 percent) finishing out the group of top contenders. Because the ROC can freely stock its roster with players from Russia’s Kontinental Hockey League, which is <a href="https://thehockeywriters.com/top-10-best-ice-hockey-leagues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely regarded</a> as the world’s best non-NHL league, its drop-off in talent without NHL players was not nearly so steep as it was for Canada and the U.S. In fact, the “OAR” (Olympic Athletes from Russia) roster <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2018_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_team_rosters#Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from 2018</a> was made up entirely of KHL players, and it outscored opponents 27-9 en route to gold in South Korea.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/krejci-staal-power-among-olympic-hockey-players-to-watch/2022/02/07/69f18e18-87e7-11ec-838f-0cfdf69cce3c_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t as though</a> the Canadian and American rosters will be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_hockey_at_the_2022_Winter_Olympics_%E2%80%93_Men%27s_team_rosters#Canada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">totally devoid of recognizable talent</a> in Beijing. Canada’s captain, Eric Staal, has scored <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/s/staaler01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more than 1,000 career NHL points</a> and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everything-that-could-go-wrong-for-the-buffalo-sabres-has-gone-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may make the Hall of Fame</a> someday — though at age 37 he is very much past his prime. Many of the top players taken in <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_2021_entry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent</a> <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/draft/NHL_2020_entry.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NHL drafts</a> will also be present, including both of the top two picks in 2021 (Canada’s Owen Power and Matthew Beniers of the U.S.). Other former NHL names in the tournament include David Krejčí of the Czech Republic, who <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/k/krejcda01.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scored 730 points</a> in a 15-year career with the Boston Bruins.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If there is a silver lining, the NHL’s decision to back out of the Beijing Olympics will <a href="https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/sports/beijing-winter-olympics/after-nhl-backs-out-beijing-olympics-will-showcase-hockeys-next-generation/2783261/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open up opportunities</a> for an exciting young generation of players to show off on a global stage. But that won’t fully make up for most of the world’s best players not being present. While Canada and the U.S. could always surprise, they went from favorites to also-rans without their NHL talent bases — and in their place, the Russian Olympic Committee picked up the torch of the favorite once again.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-paragraph="main">Each year during the Super Bowl, sportsbooks around the world offer prop bets on everything from the result of the opening coin toss to the person the Super Bowl MVP will mention first in his speech. Typically, books are quite careful about the odds they post and the bets they accept. After all, if they weren’t cautious, they wouldn’t be in business for long. But the Super Bowl makes everyone a little bit crazy, and books can sometimes offer good odds on exotic bets that are hard to properly price. And the wagers make for interesting puzzles. In previous years, we’ve analyzed props on how long Gladys Knight would take to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-super-bowls-best-matchup-is-gladys-knight-vs-the-clock/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sing the national anthem</a>, the most likely opening song in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-tried-to-predict-j-los-first-song-at-the-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jennifer Lopez’s halftime show</a>, and which word <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/poetry-at-the-super-bowl-you-can-bet-on-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amanda Gorman would utter first</a> during the performance of her pregame poem. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year we’re conducting our most ridiculous analysis yet: We attempt to handicap whether the price of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bitcoin</a> will rise or fall during the Super Bowl. As of this writing,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="35" href="#fn-35" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5 p.m. Eastern on Feb. 7.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-35">35</sup></a> the odds that bitcoin — the cryptocurrency that some love, and others love to hate — will rise are slightly higher than the odds that it will fall, at least according to the online sportsbook Bovada. The money line for the wager that the price of bitcoin will rise is currently priced at -130, which represents an implied probability of 56.5 percent (inclusive of the sportsbooks’ margin, or vigorish). Meanwhile, the line for a bitcoin Super Bowl retreat is even, good for an implied probability of 50 percent. Bovada apparently believes the bulls will be out on Super Bowl Sunday, pumping up the price of bitcoin. But is it on the right side of this particular wager?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Before we answer that question, we should first delve into the drivers of bitcoin price fluctuations — and there are <a href="https://charts.woobull.com/bitcoin-volatility-vs-other-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lot of fluctuations</a>. Unlike other tradable assets like commodities or equities, bitcoin’s price doesn’t typically move on changes in the cryptocurrency’s underlying fundamentals. The code that controls bitcoin continues to change as <a href="https://bitcoincore.org/en/releases/0.21.0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new features are added</a>, but the basic underpinnings of the cryptocurrency that affect the scarcity — and thus, at least ostensibly, the price of a bitcoin — have been fairly stable over the past decade.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="36" href="#fn-36" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For instance, bitcoin has had no “hard forks” — changes to the code that obsolete previous versions of the software — &lt;a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/alert/2012-02-18-protocol-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;since 2012&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-36">36</sup></a> Instead, the price of bitcoin is driven by speculation. Investors bet on what other investors will do in the future, and if enough people believe that <em>other people believe</em> that bitcoin will go up in price, and act on it, bitcoin will indeed go up in price. Some refer to this type of behavior as a <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/speculativebubble.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speculative bubble</a>, and we’ll be engaging in exactly this type of analysis to understand which side of this wager to bet.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First, to ground our expectations, we need a base rate. We used BTC closing price data posted <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Kaggle</a> by <a href="https://mcz.fyi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zielinski</a> from 2012 through March 2021, collected at one-minute intervals from various exchanges.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="37" href="#fn-37" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Closing price is the price of bitcoin at the end of each one-minute interval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-37">37</sup></a> We filtered the price data to just those trades that occurred from the kickoff to the final snap of each Super Bowl since 2013.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="38" href="#fn-38" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is not enough BTC trade data to conduct a price analysis for earlier Super Bowls. Some timestamps are missing trade or activity info; as a result, the earliest available transactions for the Super Bowls held in 2013 and 2014 are in the fourth and 35th minutes of play, respectively. Additionally, the latest available data for the 2013 Super Bowl is also five minutes before the final whistle.

It wasn’t until 2017 — when <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-29/tom-brady-gisele-b-ndchen-take-equity-stake-in-crypto-firm-ftx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now-noted cryptocurrency enthusiast Tom Brady</a> led the New England Patriots to a historic comeback <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7NRx9J7Too" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after falling behind 28-3</a> to the Atlanta Falcons — that bitcoin ended its first Super Bowl with a price higher than when the game started. The tenacious currency followed its first win with another in Super Bowl LII. Two years of losses followed in Super Bowl LIII and Super Bowl LIV before bitcoin rebounded last year in Brady’s final Super Bowl win, with Tampa Bay.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s perhaps fitting that the only Super Bowls over the past nine years in which bitcoin’s price rose were ones that involved Brady. Or maybe it’s just because Brady <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-brady-retires-with-all-the-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">played in so damn many</a> Super Bowls. But while Brady won seven of the 10 times he stepped on the field for a championship game, bitcoin has fared much worse: In six of the past nine Super Bowls, the cryptocurrency has lost value over the course of the game.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With this base rate of 66.6 percent in hand, we can look for reasons to adjust our expectation for bitcoin’s price at the end of Super Bowl LVI. Most promising for bitcoin bulls: The last time bitcoin was coming off an all-time high at the end of a calendar year, and subsequently followed that peak with an implosion of at least 40 percent of its total value, bitcoin’s price rose in the Super Bowl. In late 2017, bitcoin reached a then-record high of nearly $20,000, only to promptly set itself on fire in early 2018 and drop to a pregame Super Bowl LII price of $7,876. Bitcoin’s Super Bowl <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deadcatbounce.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dead cat bounce</a> was large, as bitcoin rose all the way to $8,238 by the end of the game. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Bitcoin faces a similar situation this year. After peaking at <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/121815/bitcoins-price-history.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$67,549 in early November</a>, it dipped below $40,000 last month and is currently trading around $42,000 heading into Super Bowl LVI. Speculators could leverage the game to try to pump up the price, especially if Crypto.com airs its commercial starring Matt Damon reminding viewers that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hBC5TVdYT8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fortune favors the brave</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We concede that the chance of a price drop is probably lower than 66.6 percent, but there are other reasons to short bitcoin in-game. The Super Bowl attracts millions of viewers each year, but the share of 18- to 49-year-olds that watch the game has been <a href="https://www.sportsmediawatch.com/super-bowl-ratings-historical-viewership-chart-cbs-nbc-fox-abc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">steadily decreasing</a> during the bitcoin era. In 2013, 50.2 million people in the “key demographic” watched the Super Bowl. In 2021, that number was just 34.3 million. If most bitcoin speculators are <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/google-analytics-bitcoin-demographics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">men between the ages of 18 and 45</a>, the Super Bowl seems to have become a less reliable way to reach them.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And finally, a pump isn’t worth much to a pumper without a subsequent dump. If speculators see bitcoin’s price spike during the game, they may sell en masse to lock in their profits. Most of the recent bitcoin price charts show this pattern of sell-offs after a second-half price spike, and that seems more likely than not to repeat. All of which makes a wager on bitcoin’s price falling during the Super Bowl at even money a solid value bet. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Best of all, you don’t have to buy fake money to potentially profit from betting against bitcoin. Bovada and other sportsbooks still accept dollars, and they still settle their bets with actual United States legal tender. <a href="https://nftska.com/gm-it-means-more-than-you-think-nft-terminology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Good morning</a>, crypto fam.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That NFL kickers are much better than they used to be is not a new development. The leaguewide percentage of made field goals rose steadily in the 2000s and again in the mid-2010s, to the point where kickers can now be expected to make around 84 or 85 percent of their field goals every season. (In 2019, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-thought-nfl-kickers-would-keep-getting-better-but-this-year-theyre-struggling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exceptionally weird year</a>, they made 81.6 percent.) Kickers aren’t just making more of their field goals, but they’re doing it from farther out. In the early 2000s, the average attempt was from about 36 yards out. Now, it’s from 39. The NFL has tried to rein in kickers a bit, but only with mild success — and only on extra points.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="39" href="#fn-39" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-moves-extra-point-to-15-yard-line-for-2015-season-0ap3000000493347&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;2015 rule change&lt;/a&gt; that backed extra-point kick attempts from the 2-yard line to the 15 dropped their make rate from around 99 percent to about 93 most years. It&rsquo;s a step removed from automatic, but not a big one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-39">39</sup></a> </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What <em>is </em>new is that kickers in the 2021 playoffs are pushing the position to new heights. Kickers have had postseasons with higher percentages of made field goals, but as a combination of volume, pressure and difficulty, they’ve never had as much on their plate as they’ve had this winter. They have delivered to an unprecedented extent — even to the point of the once-thought-impossible feat of taking the Cincinnati Bengals back to a Super Bowl.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So far in the playoffs, NFL kickers are 41-of-46 on field goals. Their 89.1 percent make rate is the fifth-highest in a postseason this century, most notably behind 2016’s 97.6 (40-of-41) mark.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="40" href="#fn-40" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lone miss in the 2016 playoffs came off the foot of the Green Bay Packers&rsquo; Mason Crosby: a 41-yarder in the NFC championship against the Atlanta Falcons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-40">40</sup></a> Kickers are 7-for-9 on field goals from at least 50 yards, and the average attempt has come from 39.9 yards out — compared with 38 yards in 2016’s nearly perfect postseason for kickers. The 2021 playoffs’ average kick distance narrowly trails 2017’s 40.1 yards for the longest of the century. The seven made kicks from 50-plus yards put them two made kicks behind the record nine (on 11 attempts) that kickers set in <em>last </em>year’s playoffs. (The leaguewide make percentage from at least 50 yards in regular-season games since 2000 is 59.5.) </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That looks like the continuation of a trend, rather than a true leveling-up of kicking as an art form. But kickers’ performances in high-leverage moments this postseason have set them apart even from their mega-accurate peers of recent memory. Bengals rookie kicker Evan McPherson is responsible for three of this postseason’s seven successful field goals from 50-plus yards. He hit from 54 and 52 in a divisional-round win at the Tennessee Titans, the latter coming as time expired to send Cincinnati to the AFC championship. Then he hit another 52-yarder in the fourth quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs before kicking the game-winner in overtime from a comparatively paltry 31 yards.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McPherson is both a microcosm of — and a driving force behind — NFL kickers’ special showing in these playoffs. Kickers have posted slightly better make percentages in past postseasons, but there’s never been a playoffs in which they’ve so robotically drilled field goals in the biggest moments of the year. Before this year, kickers hadn’t <em>attempted</em> more than 15 fourth-quarter or overtime field goals in a postseason since at least 2000. This year, they’re 18-of-19 in those time periods, including 4-of-4 from 50-plus yards. And on PATs, kickers have missed three out of 60 in the playoffs, but they’re 13-for-13 after the third quarter. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the last two minutes of the fourth quarter alone, kickers are 6-for-6 on field goals. Two of those were 30-yard chip shots by the Los Angeles Rams’ Matt Gay, but the other four were all from 44 to 52 yards in massive pressure cookers. The Chiefs’ Harrison Butker forced overtime with buzzer-beaters in both the divisional and championship rounds, the San Francisco 49ers’ Robbie Gould flushed a 45-yarder in the Lambeau Field snow in the divisional round, and McPherson got rid of the AFC’s top seed with a 52-yarder in the divisional round. And even Gay’s shorter field goals carried plenty of pressure; L.A. won both of those games by 3 points, and his winning kick against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers not only delivered a walkoff for his team but also ended the career of the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-tom-brady-the-goatiest-of-all-the-goats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">greatest quarterback in the history of the sport</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been no recent postseason in which NFL teams have asked so much of kickers in such fraught situations. They’ve responded almost perfectly, and <em>literally </em>perfectly at the end of games. (In addition to 6-for-6 in the last two minutes of regulation, McPherson converted on the only overtime field goal attempt of the playoffs to date.)&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What’s led to this wild success in crucial spots? It’s best not to draw immediate conclusions from these playoffs alone, other than that McPherson, a 2021 fifth-round pick out of Florida who was not alive when the Bengals last won a playoff game before this year, is an iceman. But NFL kickers have been improving for decades, and at least one contributing factor is not hard to identify: specialization. As Bill Belichick explained in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvELlakyOk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a nine-minute press conference answer</a> to a question about long snappers in September, special teams units have truly become that — <em>units</em>, in which kickers, long snappers and punters (who are almost always also holders) work together throughout practices and devote themselves wholly to working as one.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That kind of whole unit has really evolved into, you know, specified snapper or a specified kicker, a specific punter, and generally the punter as the holder, so the three of those guys could work together all practice because they’re all available,” Belichick said. He assessed that friendlier field surfaces and indoor stadiums have helped, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s made kicking operations smoother, and sometimes you can see the effects on a given play. Gould’s winner at Lambeau, for instance, depended on a brilliant hold by punter Mitch Wishnowsky, who 20 years earlier might have ceded the job to a backup quarterback. With other responsibilities, that QB may have spent less time practicing holding — and may have failed to get the ball down for Gould’s right leg, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPuhwAIzrYk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as Tony Romo once did</a> on a must-make playoff field goal attempt:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed embed-youtube"><iframe loading="lazy" title="Robbie Gould GAME-WINNING Field Goal To SHOCK The Packers! | 49ers vs Packers Divisional Round" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hazQi3EePbs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">That kind of competence isn’t just a playoff thing, at least not this season. NFL kicking units have become nails on pressure kicks in general. In the 2021 regular season, they were 71-for-83 in the final two minutes (85.5 percent) of the fourth quarter. That’s easily the most makes and attempts in those situations of any season since at least 2000, even when adjusted for the league’s new 17-game schedule. And the 85.5 percent make rate on those kicks is the second-best this century, behind only 2003 (87.8 percent).&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This year’s haul included a 10-for-16 mark on 50-plus yarders in the last two minutes of the fourth quarter. One was a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oiQzvwvPzHc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking 66-yarder</a> from the Baltimore Ravens’ Justin Tucker that beat the Detroit Lions as time expired in Week 3. It’s worth wondering how long that mark, as the longest field goal ever, will stand. If an attempt like that one were to come in the Super Bowl, it would be awfully difficult not to assume the kicker was about to drill it.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Figure skating can be a lonely sport, and some athletes feel as though they have to struggle alone. That’s how Jason Brown felt when he missed his chance to go to the 2018 Olympic Games. After hitting “rock bottom,” Brown took a big step: He restructured his whole community to help him make it to the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. In this episode of “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/?s=%22the+mental+games%22">The Mental Games</a>,” we explore how an intentional, supportive community helps elite athletes — not to mention the rest of us — achieve the most ambitious goals.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Super Bowl LVI is finally here, and it offers a truly interesting — if <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-finally-have-a-super-bowl-matchup-and-its-exactly-what-we-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not exactly expected</a> — pair of combatants. Do you like star power and ferocious defense? The Los Angeles Rams could be the team for you. Or would you prefer a youthful underdog with explosive offensive talent? We might suggest rooting for the Cincinnati Bengals.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In this unconventional matchup, let’s dive into what <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Elo forecast model</a> sees in store on Super Bowl Sunday, as well as the numbers behind why either team could engineer a championship victory.</p>



<h2 id="nfc-no-4-l-a-rams-vs-afc-no-4-cincinnati"><strong>NFC No. 4 L.A. Rams vs. AFC No. 4 Cincinnati</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>6:30 p.m. ET Sunday, NBC</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Elo favorite: </strong>Los Angeles -5½ (68 percent)<br><strong>Consensus </strong><a href="https://www.vegasinsider.com/nfl/odds/las-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Vegas line</strong></a><strong>: </strong>Los Angeles -4½</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Why the Rams are favorites: </strong>By established names and experience, this is one of the biggest mismatches in Super Bowl history. <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2021_roster.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Collectively</a>, the Rams have earned 38 total Pro Bowl selections and 20 first-team All-Pro nods; the Bengals have seven and zero, respectively. (Those 20 career All-Pro selections for the Rams make them just the fifth Super Bowl team with at least that many on their roster through the season in question since 1980.)<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="41" href="#fn-41" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The others were the 2012 San Francisco 49ers, 2007 New England Patriots, 2002 Oakland Raiders and 1980 Raiders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-41">41</sup></a> While the Rams are in their prime — their average <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170802160736/https://www.footballperspective.com/2016-av-adjusted-team-age-overall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Approximate Value-weighted age</a> of 27.6 is roughly the same as that of the typical Super Bowl team (27.4) since 1980 — the Bengals (25.8) are the youngest Super Bowl team in that span, one of just three teams to make the big game with an average age under 26.0.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="42" href="#fn-42" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joining the 1981 49ers and 2013 Seattle Seahawks &mdash; admittedly good company!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-42">42</sup></a> Beyond the advantage in veteran talent and know-how, the Rams have produced a better point differential against a tougher schedule this season, which explains why Los Angeles is solidly ahead of the Bengals <a href="https://masseyratings.com/nfl/ratings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in</a> <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most</a> <a href="https://www.footballoutsiders.com/stats/nfl/team-efficiency/2021/totals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the</a> <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/fpi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">predictive</a> <a href="https://sagarin.usatoday.com/2021-2/nfl-team-ratings-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">power</a> <a href="http://www.dolphinsim.com/ratings/nfl/index_pred.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rating</a> <a href="http://massey-peabody.com/nfl-2021-power-rankings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">systems</a>. Across those seven linked ratings, L.A. has an average leaguewide ranking of 3.3, while Cincinnati’s is 11.0.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in perhaps the most pertinent X’s-and-O’s factor of the Super Bowl, quarterback Joe Burrow and the Bengals’ aerial attack will have a difficult matchup in the form of Los Angeles’s passing defense. Against the pass, the Rams rank sixth in schedule-adjusted <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/8379024/nfl-explaining-expected-points-metric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected points added</a> (EPA) per game, after finishing <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/opp.htm#passing::23" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fourth</a> in adjusted net yards per attempt allowed and <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/opp.htm#passing::21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fifth</a> in sack rate during the regular season. According to <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32176833/2021-nfl-pass-rushing-run-stopping-blocking-leaderboard-win-rate-rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESPN’s pass-blocking and pass-rushing metrics</a>, the Rams were the league’s No. 1 pass-rushing team, and the Bengals were the league’s third-worst pass-blocking team. So Burrow, the NFL’s <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing.htm#passing::24" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most-sacked QB</a> this year, might be in for a long night against Aaron Donald, Von Miller, Leonard Floyd and the rest of L.A.’s fearsome front seven.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The inverse probably won’t be true for Matthew Stafford on the other side of the ball — L.A. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32176833/2021-nfl-pass-rushing-run-stopping-blocking-leaderboard-win-rate-rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked No. 1</a> in pass-blocking and Cincy <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32176833/2021-nfl-pass-rushing-run-stopping-blocking-leaderboard-win-rate-rankings" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked just 25th</a> in pass-rushing. And the more time Stafford has to survey the field for the receiving duo of Cooper Kupp and Odell Beckham Jr. (who <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201300ram.htm#player_offense" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combined for 255 yards in the air</a> in the NFC championship game and are averaging over 200 combined receiving yards per game this postseason), the more likely it is that Cincinnati’s Super Bowl dream turns into a nightmare.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Why the Bengals can pull the upset: </strong>For all their youth and inexperience, the Bengals still have electric talent. Burrow, running back Joe Mixon and wide receivers Ja’Marr Chase and Tee Higgins became the first quartet of offensive teammates aged 25 or younger to all produce 10 or more AV for a Super Bowl team <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/1984_roster.htm#roster::11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since the 1984 Miami Dolphins</a>, and just the third ever. And despite some of the starker differences between the two teams’ resumes, many of Cincinnati’s regular-season stats barely differed from L.A.’s. The teams scored exactly the same number of points (460), and the Rams allowed only 4 fewer (372 versus 376). Burrow and Stafford had <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/passing.htm#passing::28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost identical</a> adjusted net yards per attempt rates, to go with extremely similar rates of touchdown passes and interceptions per attempt. All of which points to this matchup not being as lopsided as the names involved may suggest. Cincinnati has already pulled upsets of two teams <a href="https://stathead.com/football/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=vegas_line&amp;year_min=2021&amp;year_max=2021&amp;game_type=P&amp;team_id=cin&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99&amp;temperature_gtlt=lt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">favored by at least 4 points</a> over them (the Titans and Chiefs), so a third is hardly out of the question.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There are valid concerns about Burrow being under pressure all game long. However, he might be able to turn the Rams’ defensive tactics against them. In generating all that pressure, L.A. has blitzed 32.3 percent of the time in the playoffs, forcing opposing passers into an 18.1 raw Total Quarterback Rating overall and a miniscule 8.9 raw QBR against the extra rusher(s). But Burrow has an 82.5 QBR against the blitz this year (including playoffs), which ranks fourth among all passers, and he has the fourth-largest gap in QBR (+26.8 points) when blitzed versus not blitzed.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="43" href="#fn-43" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Granted, Stafford has the second-largest gap (+28.8), but the Bengals have only blitzed about half as often (16.2 percent) in the playoffs as the Rams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-43">43</sup></a>&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the other side of the ball, the Rams have often relied on Stafford’s heroics late in games to pull out the win — he has an 83.4 QBR in the fourth quarter this season, tops among all NFL QBs (and about 19 points higher than his overall adjusted QBR) — but the Bengals have shown an ability to adapt and shut down opposing passers as games go on this postseason. In the playoffs, Cincinnati has gone from allowing a QBR of 69 in the first halves of games to just 9 in the second halves (or overtime), often by employing fewer pass-rushers and more defenders in coverage. If the Bengals can use that tendency to short-circuit Stafford’s clutch play, don’t be shocked if Cincy’s huge edge in special teams (they’re No. 3 in EPA, versus No. 28 for L.A.) makes a difference in a close game. With 12 field goals on 12 attempts in these playoffs — including <a href="https://stathead.com/football/play_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=all&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=game_date&amp;player_id_hint=Evan+McPherson&amp;player_id_select=Evan+McPherson&amp;player_id=McPhEv00&amp;year_min=2021&amp;year_max=2021&amp;game_type=P&amp;is_scoring=Y&amp;score_type%5B%5D=field_goal&amp;game_result=W&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99&amp;quarter%5B%5D=4&amp;quarter%5B%5D=5&amp;minutes_max=15&amp;seconds_max=0&amp;minutes_min=0&amp;seconds_min=0&amp;field_pos_min_field=team&amp;field_pos_max_field=team&amp;end_field_pos_min_field=team&amp;end_field_pos_max_field=team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two game-winners</a> — kicker Evan McPherson is chasing Adam Vinatieri’s 2006 record for the most made kicks (14) in a single postseason.</p>

					</div>
				</div>
			


<p data-paragraph="main">“The quad will come.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That’s what choreographer and then-NBC figure skating analyst Sandra Bezic said as Jason Brown <a href="https://youtu.be/SBy1STE6-r0?t=384" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stepped off the ice</a> at the 2014 U.S. national championships in Boston. The young figure skater had just brought down the house with his long program set to music from “Riverdance,” and this performance, which helped earn him a spot on the <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/road-to-sochi-2014/features/2014/january/12/meet-the-2014-us-olympic-figure-skating-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 U.S. Olympic team</a>, went viral, turning the 19-year-old with a ponytail into a fan favorite. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A lot has happened in the nearly eight years since Brown’s breakout performance at Boston’s TD Garden. He cut off his ponytail, for one. He’s been to the world championships <a href="http://www.isuresults.com/bios/isufs00012123.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four times</a>, placing as high as fourth. He won the 2015 U.S. national title. And this week, he’s competing in the Olympics for the second time in his career. But the quad that Bezic predicted would come? It hasn’t. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, Brown has landed quads in practice. In November, he even <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/News/2021/November/20/Jason-Brown-Lands-Quadruple-Jump-To-Win-Grand-Prix-Medal-In-France" target="_blank" rel="noopener">landed one in competition</a> that was certified as fully rotated. Points for persistence — falls on that jump are not what you’d call gentle — but his hit-to-miss ratio on competition quads is lopsided in favor of falling or under-rotating. Brown may hit a quad in Beijing, and I sincerely hope he does — not because I need him to do one, but because I’d love to see his decadelong effort rewarded. Brown seems to want to do the jump well, and consistently well. As a longtime fan, I want for him what he wants for himself. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But quads aren’t what <em>fans</em> want from Brown. Perhaps they’d like him to clear that particular hurdle so he has a chance to get on the podium at the Olympics or in the world championships, but they don’t think less of his skating for its lack of quads. The absence of quads in his programs and his resultant placements is testament not to what Brown is missing but to what most of the other skaters don’t seem to possess — or don’t possess to the same degree: exquisite musicality, deep engagement with the audience and a mastery over his blade. That Brown continues to rank in the <a href="http://www.isuresults.com/ws/ws/wsmen.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 10 internationally</a> also serves as a reminder of all the ways most of his competitors are lacking in some regard. Without Brown around, fans — especially the younger ones or those without memories like an elephant — would probably not realize anything was missing from the other programs. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">But that appreciation alone won’t change Brown’s circumstances: The quad, and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-quad-jump-revolution-has-transformed-womens-figure-skating-how-far-will-it-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lots of them</a>, is nonnegotiable at this point in men’s figure skating. Brown’s failure to land a quad nearly cost him a spot on the 2022 Olympic team. He placed fourth at nationals after falling on his one quad attempt, a salchow, but he was still awarded the <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/figureskating/story/_/id/33026793/ice-skating-pairs-team-alexa-knierim-brandon-frazier-join-national-champs-ashley-cain-gribble-timothy-leduc-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">third and final U.S. Olympic spot</a>, somewhat controversially. He was taken ahead of the nationals’ second-place finisher, 17-year-old Ilia Malinin, who goes by “<a href="https://www.instagram.com/quadg0d/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quadg0d</a>” on Instagram — which is not at all blasphemous because his quads are really that good. (Is there only one “quad god” or several? Or is it a holy trinity kind of situation? Help me, I’m Jewish.) The <a href="https://www.usfigureskating.org/sites/default/files/media-files/2022%20Winter%20Olympic%20Games%20Selection%20Procedures%20FINAL.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">selection criteria</a>, which took into account the past two years of competition, made choosing Brown for the berth not only possible but likely, though a strong argument could have been made in Malinin’s favor. The teenager from Virginia is clearly the future of American skating and a mega-talent that should be cultivated and encouraged, which means being given competitive opportunities. Get this kid’s feet wet in major competition, get him in front of judges, have him be ready to take over from Nathan Chen when the three-time world champion chooses to retire. Had U.S. Figure Skating gone this route, it would’ve been a defensible decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">My purpose here, however, is not to relitigate the selection of Brown over Malinin; it’s fairly obvious the decision suits the sentimental part of me. This is the place from which I watch Brown perform, and it’s the place from which I write this piece.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Why do some athletes draw this sort of response, this bodily love that is sometimes out of proportion to their actual world standing,” Patricia Lockwood <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/01/31/magazine/winter-olympics-figure-skating-jason-brown.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote about Brown</a> in 2018. That year, he was just an alternate for the Olympic team after a lackluster long program at nationals. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I’m sure there’s an element of rooting for the underdog at play, and without quads, Brown certainly is that in the world of men’s figure skating. Several of the top skaters would have to make major errors before Brown would have a realistic shot at the podium. But there’s more to it than that. Usually underdogs have a scrappy quality, a rough-around-the-edges aesthetic, but Brown doesn’t project that kind of image. He leans into his edges as he glides across the ice. He holds his shoulders down, keeps his chin up, elongating his neck. Brown cuts far too beautiful a figure on the ice to ever be truly scrappy. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Beauty is not the goal of competitive sports, but high-level sports are a prime venue for the expression of human beauty,” David Foster Wallace wrote for <a href="https://ialjs.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Wallace_FedererAsReligiousExperience_NYTimes_20Aug2006.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The New York Times</a> in 2006 about the experience of watching Roger Federer play tennis.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But beauty and grace, regardless of how present and plentiful, are not often invoked in connection to men’s sports. “Men may profess their ‘love’ of sports,” Wallace wrote, “but that love must always be cast and enacted in the symbology of war: elimination vs. advance, hierarchy of rank and standing, obsessive statistics, technical analysis, tribal and/or nationalist fervor, uniforms, mass noise, banners, chest-thumping, face-painting, etc.” Wallace, a former tennis player himself, could certainly get technical in his dissection of Federer’s game when the Swiss legend was in his prime, but he seemed to prefer the metaphysical to explain what had happened on the court. For Wallace, this was a more satisfactory way of thinking about Federer’s game and his uncanny abilities.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">While men’s figure skating certainly doesn’t shy away from beauty and the discussions thereof, there is also a strong desire to defend the sport’s place in the pantheon of athletics, even though men’s and women’s figure skating were among the very first “winter” sports brought into the Olympics in 1908, before the Winter Games themselves even existed. (Every four years, it seems there’s an ill-intentioned take that <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/21767077/figure-skating-needs-transition-costumes-uniforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">questions skating’s bona fides as a sport</a>, usually on aesthetic grounds. <em>How can it be a sport if the athletes wear costumes?</em>) One of the ways skating’s athletic credentials are established is by parsing the discipline along technical lines, with discussions of required elements, scoring records, grade of executions and, say, how many quads one might attempt in a program. This way of analyzing skating is certainly important and useful. It helps distinguish different skaters and rank them, and sorting people into winners and losers is one of the main purposes of competition. It also has the unfortunate effect of reducing a performance to the sum of its parts. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In discussing what he felt was wrong with the current scoring system, which was implemented after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Winter_Olympics_figure_skating_scandal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">judging scandal</a> at the 2002 Olympics, two-time world champion and 1968 Olympic silver medalist Tim Wood told the <a href="http://skateguard1.blogspot.com/2014/04/interview-with-tim-wood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skate Guard blog</a>: “You know in high school when you dissected a frog in biology class? At the end of the dissection, it’s not a frog anymore, now is it? When you award more points for grabbing your skate and putting it behind your head than doing a spin well, you’ve completely missed the point of what figure skating is about.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For many fans, Brown is what men’s figure skating is about — the edge quality, the glide, the musicality, the beauty — and the current system doesn’t have a way to reward him for what he does so well out on the ice. His whole is greater than the sum of the parts, but the current scoring system is a “sum of its parts” kind of project. There’s a lot of truth to that, but it also ignores the way in which the <a href="https://www.usfigureskating.org/about/scoring-system" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Judging System</a> has allowed him to remain competitive and in the top 10 in the world over the past eight years, even without a quad, by milking as many points as possible out of the program components score, which is the updated way of saying “artistic impression.” Brown has received many, many perfect marks in the components category. It’s just that these stellar scores aren’t enough to overcome the quad-point deficit. </p>



<hr class="wp-block-separator is-style-dots"><p data-paragraph="main">Brown is hardly the first skater to be held back by a technical limitation. In the 1970s, skaters like Toller Cranston saw their title hopes dashed by weak performances in the school figures, though they were arguably the best free skaters of their time. (The figures were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1988/06/09/sports/no-more-figures-in-figure-skating.html?pagewanted=print" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eliminated in 1990</a>.) Cranston, like Brown, was known for his extraordinary artistry and performance quality; along with John Curry, the 1976 Olympic champion, Cranston helped revolutionize men’s figure skating into something far more expressive than what it had been during the post-war period. Brown seems a fitting heir to Cranston’s artistic legacy. In an interview with Russian media, Brown spoke of trying to push the boundaries artistically. “I’m focused on developing this part of our sport,” he said. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">His “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Y47DE8gRvM" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sinnerman</a>” short program is proof of this mission and its success. Since he debuted it nearly two years ago for the 2020-21 season, the program has been <a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2021/04/13/jason-brown-rohene-ward-sinnerman-program-alvin-ailey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">widely regarded as an instant classic</a> by figure skating fans. Set to Nina Simone’s rendition of the song, it is a step up creatively from anything that Brown has ever done before in his long senior career, which is saying something since Brown has more than a couple of hits along the way. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Drawing from the choreography and Horton technique in the “Sinnerman” portion of Alvin Ailey’s masterpiece “Revelations,” the ambition of this piece is undeniable. Most figure skating programs typically aspire to an idea of “beauty” or being “crowd-pleasing,” which are certainly great things for a skater and choreographer to aspire to. The “Sinnerman” program is certainly both of those things, but there is more there than pleasure for both performer and spectator. There is a strong artistic point of view behind the music choice and the choreography. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rohene Ward, Brown’s longtime choreographer, explained that nearly two years ago, the skater came to Chicago from his training base in Toronto, where he currently works with two-time Olympic silver medalist Brian Orser and Olympic bronze medalist Tracy Wilson, to get new programs. This was around the time we saw nationwide protests against racism and police violence in response to George Floyd’s murder by Minneapolis police. “Jason and I had never really spent a ton of time talking about social things just because we were always working on the ice,” said Ward, the first Black choreographer to be named “<a href="https://usfigureskatingfanzone.com/news/2021/2/17/figure-skating-the-tapestry-that-is-rohene-ward.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Choreographer of the Year</a>” by the Professional Skaters Association. (He has received this honor twice.) But around choreography sessions in 2020, Ward and Brown, who is Jewish and white, finally had the conversation that many in the country were having at the time. “We really got to talk about his feelings and … creatively where we were in space and time,” Ward said </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Our body language was different, and the story we wanted to tell from this was very different from where we came from in the past,” he continued. “It was really to show strength and to show power and to show unity.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Some people would question why is he [Brown] getting ‘Sinnerman,’ and is it appropriate for him to skate to [it],” Ward asked before answering the question himself: “Absolutely, it’s appropriate for him to skate to, and he should be skating to this.” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Ward, Brown was the only skater who could pull this off — perhaps aside from the choreographer himself, who was an incredible performer during his competitive career. “I knew that Jason was really the only person that I could put this on,” Ward said — the only skater currently competing who could take Ailey’s technique to a steel blade and a sheet of ice. The way it manifests in Brown’s program is in the arms, held at 90-degree angles during turns; leaning on his edge, his leg stretched to the side with his arms straight and by his ears; when he jumps into a nearly stag position before dropping to the ice on one knee. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As with many of Brown’s most beloved programs, the idea for the “Sinnerman” short program came to Ward in a vision. “I saw his final pose, I saw everybody standing, and I was just like, ‘This is what you’re going to skate to at the Olympics,’” he recalled. Ward described a similarly religious experience with choreographing Brown’s breakout “Riverdance” program. “I was such a believer in it,” Ward said. And then with the zeal of a convert, he set out to make believers of Brown and his coach at the time, Kori Ade, too. “I made him a believer, and then he made everybody else a believer.” Brown’s long program at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sbK9AleFM_k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2014 national championships</a>, which helped him place second and make the Olympic team, was a mass conversion event. The program started slow and soft but built in intensity and speed, simply never letting up. By the time the four-and-a-half-minute program was over, Brown was skating at a sprint and the arena was in raptures. People jumped to their feet before he even finished his final scratch spin. The video of that program soon went viral, turning people who hadn’t been in TD Garden or watching on TV at home into believers, too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Since that debut, Brown (along with Ward) has continued to proselytize to the skating masses, though subsequent programs weren’t as splashy as the one that put him on the map. Ward said it was a deliberate choice to not retread the “Riverdance” terrain. “We’re just going to keep growing and expanding and becoming more iconic,” Ward said of the development of Brown’s style on the ice since his early days in the senior ranks. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“We were never going to get stuck in a genre. We were always going to try something new and push the boundaries and test the waters,” he continued. “He [always] came to me with an open mind, open body, open spirit.” Ward said there were only a couple of times when he and Brown disagreed over the music selection and direction of a program. One of those times came during the 2016-17 skating season. Ward chose a very simple piano piece called “The Scent of Love” for Brown’s long program. Brown was worried that it was too slow compared with his previous programs and that spectators would get bored, but Ward thought it was the right time to pull back and strip down, letting Brown’s superb skating speak for itself. There were none of the bells and whistles of “Riverdance.” Brown’s performance was simple and poignant. His head, how he held it, where he gazed, did much of the expressive work of this piece. As he stepped off the ice after the piece at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4zigd9jRkI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skate America</a>, cameras focused on one woman, who appeared to be working at the event, moved to tears by the performance. “It was so beautiful,” she told Brown, who gave her a hug before joining his coach in the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiss_and_cry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kiss and cry</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is hardly an unusual reaction to Brown’s skating, but athletic dimensions of artistry are often forgotten when speaking about the American skater and his performance. “The pace and the cadence to keep up [with the music] the entire time, to keep that energy, that hustle … this man is running, and to keep that up for two minutes and fifty seconds at this pace is very, very difficult for him, let alone anybody. But he does it. Because of how he trains, he makes it look effortless,” Ward said, referring this time to Brown’s “Sinnerman” program. “They want to talk about how pretty he is, but they don’t want to talk about how powerful he is, regardless if he does quads or not.” Ward thinks most of the other top skaters would be hard-pressed to pull off the intricacies that Brown can with seeming ease. “These boys, they couldn’t do it if they tried.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it’s hard to fathom Brown, even if he had mastered the quad salchow, being able to skate a program as taxing and as complex as “Sinnerman” with that jump. His transitions from choreography to jump then back to skating seem virtually impossible with a quad in the mix. (Or perhaps I’m underestimating his cardiovascular fitness.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“As I work so hard to build my technical content, I’m not willing to lose that amazing performance quality that I, you know, instantly fell in love with,” Brown <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNNtC36JK6M" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in a recent International Skating Union video. “Technical content” is undoubtedly a euphemism for quad jumps. Brown’s comments are a clear articulation of priorities. Yes, he’d like to be able to add a quad to his programs, but not at the expense of artistry. If he can’t have it all, he’ll keep doing what he’s always done — moving spectators with creative, beautifully expressed programs. And honestly, that’s more than enough. </p>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-paragraph="main">The last time the world saw Chloe Kim compete at the Olympics, the 17-year-old so thoroughly toppled the field that she earned the tacit flex of a victory lap. Kim had already captured the hearts of millions of people with relatable social media fare <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/chloe-kim-tweet-breakfast-sandwich-gold-medal-2018-winter-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on food cravings</a>, and she had handily defeated her competition in the women’s halfpipe by a full 4.0 points. But she still needed to get to the bottom of the course in Pyeongchang before the official celebration could commence.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rather than breeze past the jumps that accompany a typical path through the halfpipe, Kim <a href="https://youtu.be/3opTwpiCZ6c" target="_blank" rel="noopener">used the run</a> to reset her winning score behind back-to-back 1080s (three full rotations) and a frontside 900. “It was the best run that she’s ever done,” <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/02/13/sports/olympics/chloe-kim-halfpipe-gold.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Rick Bower, then the halfpipe coach of the U.S. snowboard team. That may have been selling the performance short: No woman had <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/sport/chloe-kim-snowboard-winter-olympics-intl/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ever landed</a> consecutive 1080s at the Olympics,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="44" href="#fn-44" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She had become the first woman to hit the trick back-to-back in competition &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/chloe-kim-becomes-first-woman-land-two-1080-spins-wins-n513911" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;&lt;em&gt;two years earlier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-44">44</sup></a> and the win made Kim the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/news/the-most-asked-questions-about-chloe-kim#:~:text=At%20the%20Winter%20Olympic%20Games,shy%20of%20the%20perfect%20100" target="_blank" rel="noopener">youngest woman ever</a> to win a gold medal in the sport. (She might have medaled four years earlier in Sochi but was <a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/02/06/four-years-later-chloe-kim-doesnt-regret-missing-sochi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ineligible</a> to compete at just 13 years old.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That dominance continued throughout 2018, as Kim <a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/10/chloe-kim-is-first-woman-to-land-frontside-double-cork-1080-in-halfpipe" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pioneered</a> another trick — the frontside double cork 1080 (three full rotations on two different axes)<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="45" href="#fn-45" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim was the first woman to land the move that fellow American snowboarder Shaun White used to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/18/sports/olympics/18snowboard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;capture&lt;/a&gt; the 2006 gold medal in Turin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-45">45</sup></a> — and became the <a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2018/03/10/chloe-kim-wins-burton-us-open-video/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first halfpipe rider</a> to sweep the Olympics, the X Games and the U.S. Open in a calendar year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Four years later, Kim continues to set the tone for her peers. An <a href="https://www.latimes.com/sports/story/2019-10-03/chloe-kim-explains-decision-to-leave-snowboarding-year" target="_blank" rel="noopener">anguished transition</a> to celebrity life resulted in Kim leaving the sport <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/michellebruton/2021/01/23/22-months-removed-from-last-snowboarding-competition-chloe-kim-wins-laax-open-halfpipe-final/?sh=14814e7a7bfb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for 22 months</a> to briefly enroll at Princeton. She returned to snowboarding in January 2021 and has won every competition since: first the <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/american-snowboarder-chloe-kim-wins-first-competition-in-22-months/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laax Open</a>, then the <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/News/2021/March/13/Chloe-Kim-Cruises-Past-Field-To-Defend-World-Halfpipe-Title" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Championship</a>, then the <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/News/2021/March/21/Chloe-Kim-Goes-2-For-2-In-2021-World-Cup-Action-With-Win-In-Aspen" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Grand Prix</a>, then the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg2l2dbK1l4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laax Open</a> again. Three of those four wins have had margins wider than 4.0 points, including the <a href="https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/results.html?sectorcode=SB&amp;competitorid=191262&amp;raceid=17655" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2021 Laax Open</a>, which was decided by a staggering 13.25. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Such is Kim’s dominance that any result less than gold in Beijing would register as an earthquake.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“She is the greatest women’s snowboarder of all time,” <a href="https://time.com/6140099/chloe-kim-2022-olympics-snowboarder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Arielle Gold, who won a bronze medal in the halfpipe in Pyeongchang. “By far.”</p>

The margin for error in snowboarding is as thin as the board, and with each rider given just a handful of runs at each event, unmitigated dominance is <a href="https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/statistics.html?statistictype=positions&amp;positionstype=position&amp;offset=50&amp;sectorcode=SB&amp;seasoncode=&amp;categorycode=OWG&amp;gendercode=W&amp;competitornationcode=&amp;place=&amp;nationcode=&amp;position=4&amp;disciplinecode=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incredibly rare</a>. Kim has missed the podium only twice in her 14-start <a href="https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/athlete-biography.html?sectorcode=SB&amp;competitorid=191262&amp;type=career" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Cup career</a> and is undefeated at world championships and Olympics. She has <a href="http://www.xgames.com/athletes/3088782/chloe-kim" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never</a> missed the podium in eight appearances at the X Games.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kim will join U.S. snowboarding legend Shaun White as one of the <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/chloe-kim-shaun-white-lead-2022-us-olympic-snowboard-team" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most marketable</a> athletes in Beijing. And although she’s 14 years younger than the Flying Tomato, Kim already has a legacy that rivals his.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">White certainly has the edge in X Games dominance, where he’s the <a href="http://www.xgames.com/athletes/3014000/shaun-white" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most decorated</a> rider of all time,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="47" href="#fn-47" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His 13 snowboarding medals outpace her six.&lt;/p&gt;

<p data-paragraph="main">But efficiency favors Kim, who in <a href="https://www.fis-ski.com/DB/general/statistics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">26 fewer starts</a> in halfpipe events has just two fewer victories. If Kim’s dominance holds, it won’t take long for her resume to eclipse just about every rider that came before her.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">“She’s pushing the boundaries of what’s possible for women’s snowboarding,” <a href="https://time.com/6140099/chloe-kim-2022-olympics-snowboarder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> Gold. “She’s doing tricks that some of the men don’t even want to. It’s pretty crazy.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Those never-seen-before tricks should be on display in Beijing, where Kim said she plans to unveil three new ones. “They’re an upgrade from everything I’ve done,” she <a href="https://time.com/6140099/chloe-kim-2022-olympics-snowboarder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>. “I’m going to go off.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Rare is the sport without so much as a lukewarm argument over its GOAT. There simply isn’t one to be one had in the halfpipe of women’s snowboarding. The event has come a long way since Germany’s Nicola Thost won the inaugural gold medal at the 1998 Olympics in Japan while No Doubt’s “I’m Just a Girl” blasted from the <a href="https://olympics.com/en/video/nicola-thost-snowboard-women-s-halfpipe-run-2-nagano-1998" target="_blank" rel="noopener">speakers</a>. Kim has done her part to take the sport to new heights, with each drop-in an opportunity to innovate. </p>]]></content:encoded>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Did you tune into (or are you currently watching) the opening ceremonies for the Winter Olympics Friday morning? Did you even realize the opening ceremonies were happening? If not, you’re not alone. Polling shows enthusiasm for the Games is muted, and while the Winter Games <a href="https://www.sportsbusinessjournal.com/en/SB-Blogs/COVID19-OpEds/2022/02/02-Erickson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are typically not as popular</a> as Summer Games in the U.S., the fact that the Olympics are being held in China doesn’t help. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">American interest in the Games is lower than it has been in the past. According to an <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/us-and-global-public-attitudes-2022-beijing-winter-olympics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ipsos poll</a> conducted ​​Dec. 23–Jan. 7, 42 percent of adults said they were interested in the upcoming Games, compared with 55 percent ahead of the last Winter Olympics, in 2018. Just 45 percent of American adults said they planned to watch some or a lot of the Olympics, according to a <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/31/beijing-olympics-viewership/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 25-27. That’s roughly the same as the percentage who said they planned to watch the Summer Games in Tokyo last year, though that marked a record low for viewership intent according to the pollster.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The reasons for that dip are mysterious and multifaceted. Of those who told Morning Consult that they don’t plan to watch, 65 percent said it was because they aren’t interested in the events, and 57 percent said it’s because they aren’t interested in the athletes (13 percent, meanwhile, blamed the time zone difference). There are likely a number of underlying factors provoking this lack of interest: For one thing, the last Olympic Games were just six months ago, so there may be a bit of event fatigue since the Games are typically spaced out every two years. There’s also been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/sports/tv-ratings-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a general decline</a> in TV ratings for sports in recent years. And, as mentioned above, the Winter Olympics tend to be a tougher sell for American audiences compared with the Summer Games. Meanwhile, 40 percent in the Morning Consult poll said they don’t plan to watch the Olympics this year because they are opposed to China hosting the Games, and 31 percent cited it as a “major” reason.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is a politics column, so let’s focus on that stat a bit. Americans’ views toward China have become more chilly in recent years: a Pew Research Center <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2021/03/04/most-americans-support-tough-stance-toward-china-on-human-rights-economic-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey last February</a> found 67 percent of U.S. adults felt very or somewhat “cold” toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Among Republicans, those feelings were stronger, with 79 percent of Republicans feeling the chill. In a <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/01/31/more-adults-approve-than-disapprove-of-u-s-diplomatic-boycott-of-olympics-few-have-heard-much-about-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pew Research Center survey</a> conducted Jan. 10-17 this year, Americans were more likely to say that, on balance, they consider China a competitor rather than an enemy, but among Republicans that trend reversed: 52 percent of Republicans said China was an enemy, compared with 40 percent who considered the nation a competitor.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The choice to host the Games in Beijing has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/20/1074500316/as-the-olympics-near-activists-criticize-chinas-alleged-human-rights-violations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contentious due to China’s human rights record</a>, including <a href="https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/19/break-their-lineage-break-their-roots/chinas-crimes-against-humanity-targeting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">abuse and violence</a> against ethnic and religious minorities in the country, such as predominantly Muslim Uyghurs. In response to the criticism, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/12/06/2022-winter-olympics-biden-announces-diplomatic-boycott-beijing/8837884002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Biden administration</a> chose not to send an official delegation to the Games (as did <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/us-nations-holding-diplomatic-boycott-beijing-games/story?id=82461768" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a handful of other</a> nations), a kind of “diplomatic boycott.” In a <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/2/2/the-us-diplomatic-boycott-against-the-beijing-olympics-is-popular-with-voters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll conducted by Data for Progress</a> from Dec. 15-18 (shortly after the boycott was announced), 67 percent of likely voters supported the decision not to send a delegation, and a plurality of American adults either somewhat or strongly approved of the boycott, according to the January Pew survey. But that Pew survey also showed just 9 percent of adults had heard a lot about it. In fact, 45 percent hadn’t heard anything about the boycott at all. Among those who had heard a lot about it, 69 percent approved of the decision. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Some Americans want U.S. corporations to take a stand as well. When asked whether they think “companies should withdraw their advertisements for the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics in response to human rights violations by the Chinese government,” 54 percent of U.S. adults said probably or definitely yes, according to a <a href="https://static.grid.news/NationalTrackingPolls/2201140_topline_GRID_BEIJING_OLYMPICS_Adults_v1_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grid/Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 22-23. Just 34 percent of U.S. adults somewhat or strongly support brands or companies sponsoring the Olympics, according to a separate <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/02/01/olympic-sponsors-china-human-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morning Consult poll</a> conducted Jan. 29-31, while 58 percent would support brands pulling out of the Games. However, brands might be able to win support simply by issuing a statement condemning China’s actions: 55 percent of U.S. adults said they would support such a move. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Notably, though, Americans still stand behind athletes who chose to attend the Games: 63 percent said they support U.S. athletes participating in the Games, according to that Grid/Morning Consult poll. It captures a sentiment that has been commonly expressed in the run-up to the Games: It’s fair to criticize the International Olympic Committee for selecting China as a host, and it’s fair to criticize China for its history. But many argue there’s no need to punish the athletes, for whom the chance to compete at the highest level is often a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. One that, judging by the polling, many Americans won’t see.</p>



<h2 id="other-polling-bites"><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>According to a Jan. 21-24 Data for Progress poll of likely voters, 58 percent said they would support the Biden administration <a href="https://www.dataforprogress.org/blog/2022/1/27/a-majority-of-voters-support-biden-striking-a-deal-with-russia-to-avoid-war-in-ukraine">striking a diplomatic deal with Russia</a> to avoid war with Ukraine. Democrats, in particular, favored diplomacy, with 71 percent in favor. A slight plurality (46 percent) of Republicans agreed. However, when Americans were asked in a Jan. 28-29 ABC News/Ipsos poll about the U.S. <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/president-biden-continues-lose-ground-american-public">sending troops to eastern Europe</a> to try to discourage Russia from invading Ukraine, respondents were split: 38 percent said they opposed sending troops, 29 percent supported it and 32 percent said they didn’t know.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans’ views of the economy are still mostly pessimistic. According to a <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx">Jan. 3-16 poll by Gallup</a>, 67 percent said they thought the economy was getting worse versus 29 percent who said it was getting better. They did find one bright spot, though: the job market. A 43 percent plurality predicted that the unemployment rate would decrease over the next six months. In addition, 72 percent said now was a good time to get a quality job — among the highest figures the pollster has recorded since it began tracking the question in 2001.</li></ul><ul><li>The majority of parents of school-age children (67 percent) believe that pandemic-related educational disruptions have put their children <a href="https://civicscience.com/majority-of-parents-say-kids-are-behind-academically-right-now-except-for-this-group/">somewhat or very behind in school</a>, according to a Jan. 19-26 CivicScience poll. And while children from higher-income families <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12187-020-09782-0">generally perform better in school</a>, parents who made more than $125,000 a year were more likely (80 percent) to believe the pandemic put their children behind educationally than those who made less than $35,000 a year (65 percent).</li></ul><ul><li>While there’s <a href="https://www.ipsos.com/en-us/news-polls/axios-ipsos-coronavirus-index">widespread support</a> for the Biden administration’s decision to mail free at-home COVID-19 tests to anyone who wants one, fewer than half (47 percent) were able to <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/articles-reports/2022/01/31/who-requested-free-home-covid-tests-government">successfully request one</a>. In a Jan. 22-25 Economist/YouGov poll, fully vaccinated adults were much more likely to have successfully requested an at-home COVID-19 test (54 percent) compared with those who say they will not get the jab (27 percent). Instead, a majority (70 percent) of unvaccinated adults said they hadn’t tried to request one.</li></ul><ul><li>Americans are largely satisfied with their own lives but dissatisfied with the direction of the country as a whole. Eighty-five percent said they were very or somewhat satisfied with how things were going in their personal lives, while just 17 percent said the same for the United States, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389375/satisfaction-own-life-five-times-higher.aspx">according to Gallup</a>. People with an annual household income of $100,000 or more and those who attend religious services weekly were most likely to report satisfaction with their personal lives (at 94 and 92 percent, respectively). While nonwhite people (27 percent) and Democrats (30 percent) were the most likely to be satisfied with the direction of the country, just 12 percent of white people and just 4 percent of Republicans said the same.</li></ul><h2 id="biden-approval"><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>
