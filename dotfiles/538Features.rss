<p data-paragraph="main">The NBA trade deadline has come and gone, and it was quite a doozy. There’s been a whole lot of moving and shaking over the last week or so — and not just among teams looking to make financially motivated moves. We had some real, live, landscape-altering trades.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/james-harden-and-ben-simmons-got-the-moves-they-wanted-will-they-work-out-for-their-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">We already covered</a> the league-changing James Harden-Ben Simmons deal last week; now, let’s go through the rest of the league. The moves made ahead of the deadline fall into several different categories: those for teams focused on the future, for teams rolling the dice on certain players, for teams making targeted upgrades before the playoffs, and for teams going all-in on the play-in game.</p>



<h2 id="all-in-for-the-play-in"><strong>All-in for the play-in</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>New Orleans Pelicans, Sacramento Kings</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">New Orleans sent Josh Hart, Nickeil Alexander-Walker,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="1" href="#fn-1" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alexander-Walker was later traded again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-1">1</sup></a> Tomáš Satoranský, Didi Louzada, a protected 2022 first-round pick<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="2" href="#fn-2" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portland receives the pick this year unless it falls between picks 1 and 4 or 15 and 30, in which case it rolls over to the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-2">2</sup></a> and two future second-round picks <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33244215/sources-portland-trail-blazers-sending-cj-mccollum-new-orleans-pelicans-part-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the Portland Trail Blazers</a> (more on them later) for CJ McCollum, Larry Nance Jr. and Tony Snell.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">McCollum’s contract is onerous, he’s a small guard on the wrong side of 30, and he’s dealt with injury issues over the past couple seasons. But he is a <a href="https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1491219573898579971" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Professional Scorer</a> who gives Brandon Ingram (and Zion Williamson, if he ever returns to the floor) a better perimeter creator to work with than they’ve had at any time in the recent past. His <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/mccolcj01.html#adj_shooting" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in-between game</a> should give him a chance to develop strong two-man chemistry with Jonas Valančiūnas, much like he did with Jusuf Nurkić in Portland. He’s also experienced at taking advantage of second-side opportunities like the ones Ingram can create for him, thanks to his extensive history with Damian Lillard. (Lillard, obviously, could create better opportunities than Ingram can.) Nance is a nice fit in the lineup as a replacement for Hart, but he also <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33256734/larry-nance-jr-recently-traded-new-orleans-pelicans-expected-6-weeks-knee-surgery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">needs knee surgery</a> and is expected to miss up to six weeks.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Pellies are 21-23 <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/no/new-orleans-pelicans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">since their disastrous</a> 1-11 start to the season, and they apparently fancy themselves a playoff squad. Our <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RAPTOR-based projection system</a> initially bumped New Orleans’s chances of making the playoffs by a few percentage points, but only to 35 percent. It’s one thing to go all-in to make the NBA Finals, but wholly another to do it in an effort to make it through the play-in tournament and thus earn the right to get smoked by the Phoenix Suns or Golden State Warriors in the first round. Was the price the Pelicans paid in this deal worth that much, if they’re still not even a 50-50 bet to play real playoff games? (The play-in is not the playoffs, folks. It might be the postseason, but it’s not the real tournament.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Kings made a similar all-in push, though they were 20-35 at the time of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33244860/indiana-pacers-sacramento-kings-work-six-player-trade-includes-domantas-sabonis-tyrese-haliburton-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their big trade for Domantas Sabonis</a>. When you <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/SAC/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven’t made the playoffs</a> in 16 years, even an outside shot at grabbing the No. 10 seed is apparently too enticing to pass up. I feel sort of bad that Sabonis has been slighted in the wake of Sacramento’s trade, which sent Tyrese Haliburton, Buddy Hield and Tristan Thompson to Indiana for Justin Holiday, Jeremy Lamb and a top-55 protected second-round pick, along with the two-time All-Star big man. Sabonis is <em>really good</em>, and one of the few guys in the league who is basically a guaranteed 20-10-5 on a nightly basis. We saw in his first two games with the team just <a href="https://www.sacbee.com/sports/nba/sacramento-kings/article258234593.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what kind of effect</a> he can have on an offense. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The issue many observers (myself included) have with the deal is the inclusion of Haliburton, who looks like he has the potential to be a foundation-of-the-offense type of guard. He can play on and off the ball, has shot <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/halibty01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">better</a> than 40 percent from deep in each of his first two seasons, is a solid rebounder, can defend multiple positions and still has plenty of room for growth, given his <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/halibty01.html#advanced" target="_blank" rel="noopener">below-average</a> usage rate. Producing like he already has (14.3 points, 3.9 rebounds, 7.4 assists per game prior to the trade) while filling a decidedly complimentary role is impressive. He is simply not the kind of player teams should be trading away while still on his rookie contract. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Sacramento’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260382/sacramento-kings-acquire-donte-divincenzo-part-four-team-trade-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">follow-up deal</a> in which it acquired Donte DiVincenzo, Trey Lyles and Josh Jackson for Marvin Bagley III was a much stronger move. Salvaging any sort of value for Bagley, who has disappointed since being tabbed as the No. 2 overall pick in the <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/draft/NBA_2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2018 NBA draft</a>, would have been a win. Acquiring DiVincenzo — who, remember, the Kings wanted to get in the failed Bogdan Bogdanović <a href="https://www.si.com/nba/2020/12/21/bucks-lose-2022-draft-pick-bogdan-bogdanovic-trade-violate-tampering-rules#:~:text=The%20NBA%20has%20stripped%20the,free%20agency%20discussions%20were%20allowed." target="_blank" rel="noopener">sign-and-trade</a> in the “summer” of 2020 — is a nice move. He’s been <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/d/divindo01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rusty</a> this year since coming back from an ankle injury that knocked him out of last year’s title run, but he makes a ton of sense as a dribble hand-off partner for Sabonis and a second-side threat to play off of De’Aaron Fox. If he can rediscover his shooting touch, he should at least help Lamb and Holiday approximate what the team lost in Hield. Plus, Lyles is having the best season of his career and has become a respectable backup big man, and should fit better on this team than did Thompson.</p>



<h2 id="targeted-upgrades"><strong>Targeted upgrades</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Cleveland Cavaliers, Milwaukee Bucks, Toronto Raptors, Boston Celtics, Phoenix Suns, Charlotte Hornets, Los Angeles Clippers</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is the group of teams that, in my opinion, did the best work at (or near) the deadline.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Cavaliers <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33232735/sources-cleveland-cavs-acquire-caris-levert-trade-indiana-pacers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> Caris LeVert and a second-round pick for Ricky Rubio (who is out for the season), a lottery-protected first-round pick and two seconds. LeVert has come off the bench in his first few games with the team but quickly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OkswPWfrZr8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rediscovered his chemistry</a> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26Z0zvJwAmQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">once</a> and future teammate Jarrett Allen and also played as part of Cleveland’s <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/playbyplay/_/gameId/401360644" target="_blank" rel="noopener">closing</a> five-man unit. He’s very much a Rorschach test kind of player, good at a bunch of things but not necessarily great at any of them. With the Cavs sapped of their guard depth, though, they desperately needed someone who can create off the bounce. LeVert can definitely do that, alleviating some of the pressure on Darius Garland to do it all on his own. LeVert averages 16.3 drives per game, <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/drives/?sort=DRIVES&amp;dir=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th-most</a> in the NBA. He’s also still 27 years old and under contract for next year, so the Cavs can more comfortably let the currently injured Collin Sexton walk if some other team signs him to an offer sheet in free agency this summer. They paid a high price, but for a player tailor-made to fill their biggest current role hole.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Bucks snagged Serge Ibaka (and two future second-round picks) in the aforementioned DiVincenzo deal. It may or may not signal some pessimism on their part regarding Brook Lopez’s return from his back surgery, though the Bucks did recently <a href="https://twitter.com/JamalCollier/status/1491227838267248640?s=20&amp;t=PTefXB6LQlamP9pBZVp8ZA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">express hope</a> that they’ll get their starting center back this season. Ibaka is solid insurance just in case they don’t, and he can spare Bobby Portis from the ultra-heavy minute load he’s been carrying during the regular season — provided Ibaka himself can remain healthy. After the Bucks apparently chose Grayson Allen (acquired and then <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/32425654/grayson-allen-agrees-2-year-20m-extension-milwaukee-bucks-agent-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">extended</a> this past offseason) over DiVincenzo, they figured out a way to turn the latter into a potentially valuable piece before having to deal with his restricted free agency. Their wing depth is a little thin without DiVincenzo, but they also played without him to begin the season and can scour the buyout market if they get the feeling that George Hill and/or Pat Connaughton won’t make it back in time to be a factor in the playoffs.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Raptors <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260476/sources-toronto-raptors-send-goran-dragic-picks-san-antonio-spurs-thad-young-drew-eubanks-pick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> Goran Dragić and a protected first-round pick to the San Antonio Spurs for Thaddeus Young, Drew Eubanks<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="3" href="#fn-3" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who was &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.si.com/nba/raptors/news/toronto-raptors-waive-drew-eubanks-san-antonio-spurs-trade&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;then waived&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-3">3</sup></a> and a second-round pick via the Detroit Pistons. They continue stocking up on players who are all basically the same size and have incredibly long arms. With the exception of Fred VanVleet, every player in Toronto’s rotation is between 6-foot-5 and 6-foot-9 and weighs between 200 (Chris Boucher) and 235 pounds (Young). Toronto coach Nick Nurse loves to get <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-raptors-defense-is-almost-never-the-same-but-its-always-really-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as creative as possible with his defenses</a>, and Young is plenty capable of handling whatever gets thrown at him. Toronto’s roster is still a bit frontcourt-heavy, but giving Nurse another player he can trust on D so that he doesn’t have to heap so many minutes onto his starters has a lot of value. Toronto also did this only in exchange for moving back in the draft as opposed to out of it entirely, thanks to acquiring Detroit’s second-rounder this year in the deal.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Breaking with Danny Ainge’s long-standing tradition of <a href="https://www.theringer.com/nba/2021/4/6/22369749/danny-ainge-celtics-almost-trades-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener">almost making deals</a> and then going on WEEI to talk about how close he was to making deals, new Celtics president Brad Stevens made three swaps on Thursday. He <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260889/sources-boston-celtics-acquire-guard-derrick-white-san-antonio-spurs-multiplayer-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> Josh Richardson, Romeo Langford, a protected first-round pick and a future pick swap to the Spurs for Derrick White; Dennis Schröder, Enes Kanter Freedom and Bruno Fernando <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33261566/boston-celtics-deal-dennis-schroder-enes-freedom-houston-rockets-daniel-theis-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the</a> Houston Rockets for Daniel Theis; and P.J. Dozier, Bol Bol, a future second-round pick and cash to the Orlando Magic <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1491826775030181893" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for</a> a future second-round pick. The trio of moves got Boston an upgrade to their closing lineup (who also improves a defense that has been the <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/advanced/?sort=DEF_RATING&amp;dir=-1&amp;Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;DateFrom=01%2F01%2F2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">league’s best</a> since the calendar turned to 2022) and a backup big man who Ime Udoka can trust on defense, while also ducking the luxury tax line. Not bad for a day’s work. White has fit in spectacularly well early on, and should help Boston continue its rise up the standings.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Suns <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260921/phoenix-suns-finalizing-trade-reacquire-torrey-craig-indiana-pacers-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">salvaged</a> some value out of Jalen Smith, sending him along with a second-round pick to the Pacers in exchange for Torrey Craig, who played a valuable role in their run to the NBA Finals last season. Smith was a surprise pick when the Suns took him at No. 10 overall in 2020 and then didn’t do much as a rookie, so the team <a href="https://www.brightsideofthesun.com/2021/11/3/22759864/just-how-rare-is-phoenix-suns-declining-jalen-smiths-third-year-option" target="_blank" rel="noopener">declined</a> his third-year option. When pressed into action due to injuries this year, though, Smith <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/smithja04/gamelog/2022#39-48-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looked pretty good</a>. The Suns probably would not have been able to retain him in free agency due to salary-cap quirks, so thought it better to get a potential playoff rotation player now than lose him for nothing later. Phoenix <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/wizards-suns-trade-holiday" target="_blank" rel="noopener">also sent</a> cash to the Washington Wizards for Aaron Holiday, who gives them an upgrade on Elfrid Payton as the backup point guard while Cameron Payne is out.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Hornets have badly needed help at center for a while now and <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/hornets-wizards-montrezl-harrell-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got some</a> in the form of Montrezl Harrell, sending Vernon Carey and Ish Smith to the Washington Wizards in exchange. After getting off to a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/h/harremo01/gamelog/2022#388-404-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spectacular start</a> to the season, Harrell hasn’t been as effective of late, and the return of Thomas Bryant meant the Wizards had a playing-time crunch at the position. It’s easy to see Harrell splitting the pivot minutes with Mason Plumlee as he did with Daniel Gafford, and to see him feasting on the board and pick-and-roll feeds from LaMelo Ball and Terry Rozier; but he unfortunately will not solve Charlotte’s rim-protection issues. The Hornets have allowed the second-most <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022.html#shooting-opponent::28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dunks</a> and 12<sup>th</sup>-most <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2022.html#shooting-opponent::28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">layups</a> in the NBA this season. Harrell is — to put it as kindly as possible — a <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/defensive-impact/?sort=DEF_RIM_FG_PCT&amp;dir=-1&amp;CF=DEF_RIM_FGA*GE*3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">subpar</a> rim-protector.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Clippers <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33216994/sources-la-clippers-acquire-norman-powell-portland-trail-blazers-5-player-trade" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kicked off</a> the series of deadline deals by sending Eric Bledsoe, Justise Winslow, Keon Johnson and a 2025 second-round pick to the Blazers for Norman Powell and Robert Covington. Yes, they turned one rotation player into two and didn’t have to give up much to do it. Powell, unfortunately, is out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nba.com/news/clippers-norman-powell-broken-foot" target="_blank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">indefinitely</a> with a foot injury suffered late last week, but they&#8217;re building a Raptors-style roster with a bunch of different-sized wings who can play alongside Kawhi Leonard and/or Paul George. Ya know, if those guys ever get healthy.</p>



<h2 id="rolling-the-dice"><strong>Rolling the dice</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Detroit Pistons, Dallas Mavericks, Washington Wizards, Utah Jazz</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Pistons are getting a free look at Bagley before he’s a restricted free agent this summer. He should get plenty of minutes as he attempts to rehab his value. If it doesn’t work out, well, they didn’t give up much anyway.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Mavs and Wizards &#8230; wow. Dallas <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33261228/sources-dallas-mavericks-trading-kristaps-porzingis-washington-wizards-spencer-dinwiddie-davis-bertans" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sent</a> Kristaps Porziņģis and a second-round pick to Washington for Spencer Dinwiddie and Dāvis Bertāns, then <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSteinLine/status/1491890012228665352" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lavished</a> Dorian Finney-Smith with a four-year, $52 million contract extension. KP has been out since late January with the latest flare-up of his recurring knee issues, and it’ll be interesting to see whether there is something more serious going on than the reported soreness that’s been keeping him off the floor. Either way, it’s safe to say that Dallas’s gamble to acquire him from the New York Knicks a few years back did not work out as expected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Dinwiddie wasn’t particularly good in Washington, and Bertāns has been a <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/bertada01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">disaster</a> since signing a new deal during the 2020 offseason. Neither player is much of a defender, and Dinwiddie isn’t much of a shooting threat, but the Mavs did need some secondary ball-handling help, and if Bertāns can rediscover his stroke, he can help replace Tim Hardaway Jr.’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tim-hardaway-jr-found-a-home-and-a-rhythm-in-dallas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">role off the bench</a> in the wake of the latter’s injury. Dinwiddie also provides insurance in case pending unrestricted free agent Jalen Brunson walks in the offseason. He should have plenty of suitors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Remember how good the Russell Westbrook trade <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-russell-westbrook-trade-is-working-out-for-the-wizards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was looking</a> for the Wizards earlier this year? Well, it still looks pretty good, given <a href="https://www.foxsports.com/stories/nba/russell-westbrook-benched-again-as-shooting-woes-continue" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what’s going on</a> with Russ. It’s just that the team hasn’t looked that good in a while, so it made sense to go in a different direction. The question here is whether the Wizards were just looking to get off of bad money or they think Porziņģis is a franchise building block for them. (Based on coach Wes Unseld Jr.’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ChaseHughesNBCS/status/1491995046584987649" target="_blank" rel="noopener">public comments</a>, it might be the latter.) Oh, and whether Porziņģis’s presence is enough to entice Bradley Beal (out for the season after <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33246228/left-wrist-surgery-end-season-washington-wizards-star-guard-bradley-beal-agent-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrist surgery</a>) to re-sign with the team on a deal it’s not clear they should want to give him in the first place. KP hasn’t been that guy in quite a while, but if he can come back from this knee issue, he should have a chance to play more of a leading role in the offense down the stretch of this season. His floor-spacing ability makes him a good theoretical fit with Beal, but tying the team’s future to that duo could be very, very risky given their respective injury histories and contract values.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Joe Ingles’s expiring contract was supposed to be Utah’s big trade piece at the deadline. The torn ACL that knocked him <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33215700/utah-jazz-joe-ingles-insists-career-continue-acl-recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out for the year</a> changed all of that, though, so the Jazz had to settle for a much smaller return than expected. Acquiring Alexander-Walker and Juancho Hernangómez <a href="https://www.nba.com/news/jazz-acquire-nickeil-alexander-walker-juancho-hernangomez" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in exchange for</a> Ingles, Elijah Hughes and a future second theoretically lengthens their rotation a bit — but that’s only true if coach Quin Snyder trusts them to keep the line moving offensively and execute on defense. Count me as skeptical on both the former (for Alexander-Walker) and the latter (for Hernangómez).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="focused-on-the-future"><strong>Focused on the future</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Portland Trail Blazers, San Antonio Spurs, Indiana Pacers</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Damian Lillard’s abdominal injury and subsequent surgery finally got Portland to acknowledge that its roster had “<a href="https://twitter.com/highkin/status/1491894674742673428" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plateaued</a>,” as interim general manager Joe Cronin put it on Thursday. The Blazers’ three trades netted Bledsoe, Winslow, Johnson and a 2025 second-round pick from the Clippers; Hart, Louzada, a protected first-round pick and two future second-round picks from the Pelicans; and Ingles, Hughes and a future second-round pick from the Jazz in <a href="https://www.nba.com/jazz/jazz-acquire-alexander-walker-and-hernangomez#:~:text=The%20Utah%20Jazz%20have%20acquired,future%20second%2Dround%20draft%20pick." target="_blank" rel="noopener">exchange</a> for Alexander-Walker, whom they’d received as part of the initial McCollum deal. Don’t expect to see Dame for the rest of this season. Instead, it’s a full-on tank job and a lot of money in Anfernee Simons’s future. Probably.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Spurs are on track to miss the playoffs for the third consecutive season for the first time in franchise history. White, at 27 years old, probably did not fit their timeline, and getting both a first-round pick and a pick swap from the Celtics probably made sense. Meanwhile, perhaps <a href="https://grantland.com/features/the-shot-doctor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">famed shooting coach</a> Chip Engelland can repair Landford’s jumper and turn him into a contributor. Maybe they can even get something for Richardson down the line. Young was not playing all that often for the Spurs, and getting a first-round pick for him was a coup — especially considering he could very well have been a buyout guy had he not been traded. After he came to San Antonio along with a first as part of the DeMar DeRozan sign-and-trade, the Spurs essentially turned a player they weren’t likely to re-sign into two future first-round picks. They now have three firsts in the 2022 draft, which they can either use to take some swings or package together to move up. Their willingness to go in this direction is interesting considering they’ve essentially never undergone a rebuild before. Perhaps Gregg Popovich is willing to stick it out through the rest of this era, until the team is set up to succeed into the future.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Indiana had to part with Sabonis and a few quality role players but made out quite well. Haliburton, as mentioned, is a potential foundational piece. They can give Jalen Smith a shot on the front line along with 2021 first-rounder Isaiah Jackson, while Myles Turner allows his foot injury to heal. This summer, the Pacers can go even further by seeing what they can get for Turner and/or Malcolm Brogdon, or they can try to remain semi-competitive by keeping those guys and allowing them to support Haliburton’s growth. Either way, it was clear that this version of their team had run its course, and they have attempted a pivot to the future.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When ice hockey player Amanda Kessel got a concussion, she thought she was doing the right thing by resting. But her migraines and dizziness didn’t improve, and she became anxious and depressed. As it turns out, rest is no longer the recommended treatment for athletes suffering from prolonged concussions. In fact, it can make them worse. It was only once Amanda started a new course of treatment involving exercise and medication that she got back on the ice. And now, she’s once again going for gold at the Olympics.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In the 2020 election, the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-how-white-and-latino-americans-voted-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rightward shift among Latino voters</a> raised eyebrows. <a href="https://catalist.us/wh-national/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Post-election surveys</a> have disagreed about <a href="https://twitter.com/A_agadjanian/status/1385639388818788355?s=20&amp;t=FfUIkI1qjxs8eHqCV2e3fw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the exact split</a> in <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2021/06/30/behind-bidens-2020-victory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Latino vote</a>, but it appears around 3 in 5 (or slightly more) voted for President Biden over then-President Donald Trump. Yet many of those same surveys as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/12/20/us/politics/election-hispanics-asians-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">precinct-level analysis</a> of the 2020 vote suggest that, compared with his performance in 2016, Trump made gains among Latinos — and <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/11/13/south-texas-voters-donald-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in some places</a>, quite <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/21/us/miami-hispanic-voters.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sizable ones</a>. Going forward, such swings among Latinos — <a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2021/08/2020-united-states-population-more-racially-ethnically-diverse-than-2010.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest ethnic or racial minority group in the country</a> — could affect each party’s chance of carrying important states like Arizona, Florida and Texas while also putting Democratic-leaning turf <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in play for the GOP</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet for all the talk about Republicans making serious inroads with Latino voters, new data from Gallup suggests that Latinos’ lurch toward the GOP could be overstated, at least when it comes to how they identify with the two major parties. In Gallup’s survey data for 2021, <a href="https://news.gallup.com/opinion/polling-matters/389093/hispanic-americans-party-updated-analysis.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the pollster found</a> that 56 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as Democrats or as independents who leaned toward the Democratic Party, while 26 percent identified as Republican or as leaning toward the GOP. Those figures represent very little change from what Gallup found in 2020 and, as the chart below shows, largely fall in line with Hispanic party-identification data over the past decade.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="Latinos continue to identify more as Democrats" aria-label="Interactive area chart" id="datawrapper-chart-EvCJJ" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/EvCJJ/5/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="500"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s been really only one inflection point in Gallup’s Hispanic party-ID data, which came around 2015 and 2016, when the share of Hispanics identifying with the Democratic Party shot up to 62 percent, while the share identifying with the Republican Party fell below 30 percent. Perhaps not coincidentally, this coincided with Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, which was <a href="https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-klinker-immigration-election-20170417-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strongly nativist</a> and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/gop-worries-rise-amid-hostile-trump-comments-on-latinos-and-muslims/2016/06/05/986545e8-2a1c-11e6-a3c4-0724e8e24f3f_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hostile toward Latinos</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, those changes didn’t necessarily produce a big shift in electoral fortunes. In fact, in 2016, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/trump-probably-did-better-with-latino-voters-than-romney-did/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump probably performed better</a> with the Latino electorate than Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had four years earlier. That’s partly because shifts in party ID may not actually be all that predictive of how Latino voters will ultimately vote.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Latinos are pretty swingy compared with other voting blocs, as they’re just not that <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1065912919888577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attached to the two major parties</a>. Case in point: In Gallup’s 2021 polling, 52 percent of Hispanic Americans identified as independent, which was 10 percentage points higher <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/388781/political-party-preferences-shifted-greatly-during-2021.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the population as a whole</a> (42 percent). And when asked if they leaned toward one party, Latino independents were more likely to identify with the Democratic Party. But since most Latino Americans first identified as independent, this means that of the 56 percent who identified as or leaned Democratic, around two in five were actually independent leaners. (Among Republicans, almost three in five were independent leaners.) And while studies show that voters leaning toward a party do tend to back that party, <a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.649.1442&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">they are still more likely</a> to vote for the other side than voters who strongly identify with a party.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And among Latinos, ties to the two parties may be particularly weak because they aren’t as likely as other Americans to form a strong partisan identity at a young age. For starters, about <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/09/09/key-facts-about-u-s-latinos-for-national-hispanic-heritage-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one-third of Latinos weren't born in the U.S.</a>, which means many haven't developed a strong allegiance to either party. As a result, many first-generation Latinos <a href="https://www.robertofcarlos.com/uploads/6/9/4/3/69439129/late_to_the_party_on_the_prolonged_partisan_socialization_process_of_secondgeneration_americans.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">haven't instilled loyalty to either party</a> in their children, which is often how younger voters in the U.S. form their partisan identities.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="4" href="#fn-4" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the various forces described here also affect other immigrant populations in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-4">4</sup></a> It’s no surprise then that younger Latinos, in particular, hold only weak affinities for the two major parties or identify as independent, as they often have to find their own way politically.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">These looser partisan attachments mean that a sizable bloc of the Latino electorate is persuadable. This was <a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/2020-post-mortem-part-one-16221adbd2f3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of the takeaways</a> from Equis Research’s post-mortem on the 2020 election, which found that <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/60668f2a28dee76b4ffebc73/1617334072783/Equis+Post-Mortem+Part+One+%28Public+Deck%29+%281%29.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trump won over many Democratic-leaning Latino voters</a>. This was true both in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-democratic-gains-in-texass-big-metro-areas-could-outweigh-republican-success-in-south-texas/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily Hispanic South Texas</a>, where the Democratic margin shrunk from 33 points in 2016 to just 17 points in 2020,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="5" href="#fn-5" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the vote totals in 28 counties along or near Texas&rsquo;s border with Mexico: Brewster, Brooks, Cameron, Culberson, Dimmit, Duval, El Paso, Frio, Hidalgo, Hudspeth, Jeff Davis, Jim Hogg, Jim Wells, Kenedy, Kinney, Kleberg, La Salle, Maverick, Nueces, Presidio, Reeves, Starr, Terrell, Val Verde, Webb, Willacy, Zapata and Zavala.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-5">5</sup></a> and in Nevada, where 11 percent of Latino voters in Trump’s coalition had backed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in 2016, according to Equis’s data.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://equisresearch.medium.com/post-mortem-part-two-the-american-dream-voter-66dd6f673d1e" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The analysis</a> from the Latino-focused research outfit pointed to Latino approval of Trump’s economic policies <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5d30982b599bde00016db472/t/61b7e8e75c74f5558036268b/1639442667560/Post-Mortem+Part+Two+FINAL+Dec+13.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as a key factor</a> that helped Trump win over Latino voters worried about how COVID-19 would impact the economy. And because concerns about COVID-19 and the economy dominated the spotlight, immigration issues that might have kept some Latinos from backing Trump became less salient. That was important because Trump’s anti-immigration and anti-Latino rhetoric had kept some more conservative-leaning Latinos from voting for him in 2016, but with immigration pushed to the background in 2020, these voters now felt more comfortable casting a ballot for Trump. Additionally, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/latino-voters-moved-to-trump-because-of-covid-and-socialism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOP attempts to label Democrats</a> as “socialists” likely contributed to these shifts as well.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That said, how Latinos voted in 2020 may also not square with Gallup’s party-affiliation data because Latinos are less likely to vote than other major racial and ethnic groups. In 2020, 54 percent of voting-eligible Latinos cast a ballot, <a href="https://clacls.commons.gc.cuny.edu/wp-content/blogs.dir/7199/files/2021/05/Laird-W.-Bergad-and-Luis-A.-Miranda-Latino-Voter-Registration-and-Participation-Rates-in-the-2020-Election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to data</a> compiled by the Center for Latin American, Caribbean, and Latino Studies at City University of New York, and while this was the highest turnout mark for Latinos on record, it still lagged well behind Asian Americans (60 percent), Black Americans (63 percent) and white Americans (71 percent).&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In other words, understanding which Latinos voted in 2020 is incredibly important. Equis found, for instance, that lower-propensity voters, many of whom were young, were less likely to have negative views of Trump than high-propensity voters, and that many ultimately backed Trump. For example, 17 percent of the Latino voters who backed Trump in Nevada in 2020 didn’t vote in 2016. Moreover, according to Equis, even though many younger Latino voters (those under the age of 50) had negative opinions of Trump, his standing among them improved by the fall of 2020. This means that as Latino voter turnout surged, especially among 18- to 44-year-olds (i.e., 60 percent of eligible Latino voters, per CUNY’s data), Trump stood to gain.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What does all this mean for Latinos’ party preferences looking ahead to the 2022 midterm elections? In short, despite the continued Democratic edge in party ID, there’s potential for the GOP to win over more persuadable Latino voters this November. Biden’s approval rating <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/biden-has-lost-support-across-all-groups-of-americans-but-especially-independents-and-hispanics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has fallen especially hard</a> among Latinos, and <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/01/25/views-of-the-national-economy-assessments-of-prices-jobs-housing-and-the-stock-market/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">like other</a> <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/i8sxn720xf/econToplines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Americans</a>, Latinos <a href="https://www.axios.com/axios-ipsos-poll-crime-latinos-c9b99c24-d495-48ae-9366-b39e619c99ef.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are particularly worried</a> about issues like the economy, COVID-19 and crime, which could benefit Republicans, especially if immigration, an issue that <a href="https://journals-sagepub-com.proxy01.its.virginia.edu/doi/pdf/10.1177/1065912919844327" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has benefited Democrats</a> among Latinos, remains mostly sidelined.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With a Democrat in the White House, we’d also expect Republican-leaning Latinos <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-the-presidents-party-almost-always-has-a-bad-midterm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to be more likely to vote</a> in a midterm. Biden’s flagging numbers may also cost Democrats support from some Latinos in the middle, as well as depress turnout among Democratic-leaning Latinos. Recent generic-ballot polling, though, <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/npwlx2cq4r/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">generally finds</a> <a href="https://assets.morningconsult.com/wp-uploads/2022/02/08222920/2202029_crosstabs_POLITICO_RVs_v2_SH.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Democrats leading</a> among Latinos, although the <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-b883-d713-a1ff-fbabf09c0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">margins have varied</a> in ways <a href="https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/01/January-16-19-2022_Topline-Tables_January-23-Release.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that could portend</a> a narrower gap between the parties. (In most cases, though, we’re relying on small samples of Latino voters within polls, so remember that means <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/09/08/understanding-the-margin-of-error-in-election-polls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">larger margins of error</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, at this point it seems more likely than not that Latino voters will continue to prefer Democrats in the upcoming midterm elections. However, given the 2020 election results, the prominent issues that voters are worried about and Biden’s standing with the public, there’s plenty of reason to think that Republicans can further trim Democrats’ lead among Latino voters in 2022 — even if Democrats retain a sizable party-ID advantage among all Latinos.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Super Bowl LVI between the Los Angeles Rams and Cincinnati Bengals was a fitting finish to an NFL season that began in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-first-week-of-the-nfl-season-was-pure-chaos-what-does-that-mean-for-the-rest-of-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">historically chaotic</a> fashion. L.A. somehow managed to trot out the worst rushing attack in Super Bowl history. The officials appeared to miss an important penalty that led to a <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33043281/questionable-nfl-playoff-officiating-decisions-happened-which-were-right-came-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tee Higgins touchdown</a> to start the second half, then threw a <a href="https://nypost.com/2022/02/13/super-bowl-2022-rams-winning-td-fueled-by-controversial-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">controversial flag</a> that kept the Rams’ go-ahead scoring drive alive. Both starting quarterbacks suffered lower body injuries (but managed to stay in the game), and Rams receiver Odell Beckham Jr. <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33284663/los-angeles-rams-wide-receiver-odell-beckham-jr-questionable-return-suffering-leg-injury" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left in the second quarter</a> with a noncontact knee injury and did not return. After the final snap, L.A. safety Taylor Rapp <a href="https://twitter.com/RamsNFL/status/1493064289883590662?s=20&amp;t=NJLgUMU3PqMPq_xgPh_5UA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposed to his girlfriend</a>. And receiver Van Jefferson’s wife, Samaria, <a href="https://twitter.com/JourdanRodrigue/status/1493065465962262535" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went into labor</a> during the game. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In the midst of all that, the Rams won the second Super Bowl in <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">franchise history</a> by relying on two of their many stars. But it wasn’t the big-name hired guns who led Los Angeles to the Lombardi Trophy; instead, it was the team’s homegrown superstars who made the difference at SoFi Stadium.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">L.A. had fallen behind Cincinnati on the first play of the second half and struggled from then on to sustain its offense. But everything changed when the team started manufacturing touches for star wideout Cooper Kupp. The Rams looked to Kupp eight times on the decisive 18-play drive,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="6" href="#fn-6" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including penalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-6">6</sup></a> beginning with a 7-yard run on fourth-and-1 from the L.A. 30-yard line. Kupp sprinkled in catches for 8, 22 and 8 yards before drawing a defensive holding penalty on third-and-goal at the 8-yard line with 1:47 left in the game. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The next two Kupp targets were also nullified by penalties, including a touchdown that was called back due to offsetting penalties on both teams. But Kupp’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=togpppH-PVc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back-shoulder catch</a> on quarterback Matthew Stafford’s toss on second-and-goal from the 1 ultimately put the Rams ahead with 1:25 remaining &#8212; and secured Kupp the title of <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33285438/cooper-kupp-named-mvp-super-bowl-lvi-late-td-lifts-los-angeles-rams-cincinnati-bengals" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Super Bowl Most Valuable Player</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But the game wasn’t over until <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-bengals-slow-down-aaron-donald-nothings-stopped-him-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Rams&#8217; other superstar</a>, Aaron Donald, officially shut the door on the Bengals’ comeback attempt. In what may end up being <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/02/13/aaron-donald-could-consider-retirement-if-rams-win-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his last NFL snap</a>, Donald closed out the game with a hit on Joe Burrow on fourth down, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMLF7AkgDAw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spinning the Bengals QB to the ground</a> and forcing him to throw an off-balance pass short of running back Samaje Perine. The play punctuated a night of defensive dominance for Los Angeles: The Rams’ defensive line created pressure against the Bengals’ offensive line on 82.1 percent of their defensive snaps, <a href="https://twitter.com/SethWalder/status/1493058077909737476" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most of any team in any game in the NFL this season</a>. The Rams converted that pressure into seven sacks, with Donald and Von Miller tying for the team lead with two apiece.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">L.A. needed Super Bowl MVP-caliber performances from Kupp and Donald in large part because the team was historically inept at running the ball against a stout Bengals run defense. L.A. averaged just 1.9 yards per rush, <a href="https://stathead.com/football/tgl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=game&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rush_yds_per_att&amp;year_min=1940&amp;year_max=2021&amp;game_type=P&amp;playoff_round=s&amp;game_num_min=0&amp;game_num_max=99&amp;week_num_min=0&amp;week_num_max=99&amp;temperature_gtlt=lt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">worst ever among Super Bowl winners</a>. Running back Cam Akers rushed 13 times for just 21 yards, and he never really stood a chance. The Rams’ offensive line was unable to open holes for him all night long: Akers netted <em>negative</em> <em>1</em> yard rushing before first contact.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Behind center, Stafford struggled after Beckham left the game. In the first half, with Beckham playing a heavy role, Stafford scored a Raw Quarterback Rating of 72.2, completing 12 of 18 passes for 165 yards, two touchdowns and an arm-punt interception in the end zone that was basically harmless. In the second half, his Raw QBR dropped to 47.9 on 14 of 22 passing for 118 yards, one touchdown and one interception. In the end, Stafford was serviceable but unspectacular, and it wasn’t until head coach and play caller Sean McVay decided to funnel the Rams’ offense through Kupp that L.A. returned to the form it showed before Beckham got hurt. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The game itself mirrored <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2021.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Ram’s season</a>, with L.A. starting hot before falling into a funk at the midway point and then finishing strong with elite performances from its star players. And that was <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-and-bengals-took-opposite-paths-to-the-super-bowl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">always the plan for the Rams</a> this season after going all-in for Stafford, Miller and Beckham. All they needed was to avoid injuries to bring general manager Les Snead’s vision to fruition.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Injuries nearly caught up with them in the biggest game of the year. But in the end, it was the elite, homegrown talent of Kupp and Donald &#8212; rather than the more recent additions via <a href="https://www.freep.com/story/sports/nfl/lions/2021/03/18/detroit-lions-matthew-stafford-trade-los-angeles-rams-official-jared-goff/4744369001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high-profile trades</a> &#8212; that has L.A. celebrating its first Rams Super Bowl victory in the city’s history.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Daryl Morey waited and waited &#8230; and waited some more. It took months of criticism over holding onto disgruntled All-Star Ben Simmons and sacrificing trade leverage in hopes of acquiring stars who were seemingly not available, but the president of basketball operations for the Philadelphia 76ers finally got the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33260613/brooklyn-nets-trade-james-harden-philadelphia-76ers-ben-simmons-seth-curry-andre-drummond-sources-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">superstar player he wanted</a>: James Harden.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">After an offseason spent <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-trades-of-all-stars-can-tell-us-about-why-ben-simmons-is-still-in-philly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trying to deal</a> the discontented Simmons and half a season with the player sitting out, the Sixers found a landing spot for him at Thursday’s trade deadline, sending Simmons, Seth Curry, Andre Drummond and <a href="https://twitter.com/wojespn/status/1491841872641368064" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two first-round picks</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="7" href="#fn-7" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their own 2022 first-rounder, which the Nets have the right to defer to 2023, along with their protected 2027 first-rounder, which Brooklyn gets so long as it falls outside the top eight picks. If it is inside the top eight, it rolls over to 2028, top-eight protected again, then becomes two second-round picks and $2 million the following year. To legally make the trade, the 76ers also have to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Dn4sty/status/1491843458981670918&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;unprotect&lt;/a&gt; the 2025 first-round pick they owe to the Oklahoma City Thunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-7">7</sup></a> to the Brooklyn Nets. In exchange, Philly got the Nets star, who had demanded (implicitly through his actions, if not necessarily his words) a trade of his own, along with Paul Millsap. As Joel Embiid said, <a href="https://twitter.com/JoelEmbiid/status/1491120272178561028" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“This is WILD</a>.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For Brooklyn, the deal brings its Big Three to an abrupt end just 13 months after the Nets <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/30706097/sources-houston-rockets-trade-james-harden-brooklyn-nets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pushed all of their trade chips</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="8" href="#fn-8" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, Taurean Prince, unprotected first-round picks in 2022, 2024 and 2026 and pick swaps in 2021, 2023, 2025 and 2027.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-8">8</sup></a> to the middle of the table to acquire Harden from the Houston Rockets and pair him with fellow stars Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving. But instead of an instant title, injury and the Milwaukee Bucks (and Durant’s <a href="https://twitter.com/royceyoung/status/1406469209434083330" target="_blank" rel="noopener">too-big shoes</a>) cut the Nets’ 2020-21 season short. This year, Durant’s latest injury (<a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33079028/brooklyn-nets-say-kevin-durant-diagnosed-sprained-mcl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a sprained MCL</a>) and Irving’s refusal to get the COVID-19 vaccine meant Harden was often flying solo on the court rather than working as part of a star trio. That simply wasn’t part of the deal, and he was apparently quite <a href="https://theathletic.com/3123409/2022/02/10/kyrie-irvings-role-in-james-harden-trade-and-is-zion-williamson-the-next-big-name-to-move-trade-deadline-first-thoughts/?source=nbatw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">frustrated</a> by it. Between this season and last, Harden, Durant and Irving spent only 365 minutes on the floor together, <a href="https://www.pbpstats.com/wowy-combos/nba?TeamId=1610612751&amp;Season=2021-22,2020-21&amp;SeasonType=All&amp;PlayerIds=201142,201935,202681" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to PBP Stats</a>. They obliterated opponents by 14.17 points per 100 possessions during that time, with an offense that would have registered as the best in league history by an enormous margin. But that didn’t seem to happen often enough to persuade Harden that he wanted to be in Brooklyn beyond this year.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Harden now heads to Philadelphia, where his new co-star is at least a semi-regular figure in the lineup. Embiid has <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/e/embiijo01.html#per_game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">never played more than 78 percent</a> of his team’s games in a given season, but he’s been out there far more often than either Durant or Irving over the past few years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s not necessarily a perfect fit. Harden has been at his best with a rim-rolling pick-and-roll partner who provides vertical spacing so he can do damage off the drive, step into space to isolate or fling the ball to shooters dotting the perimeter. The Sixers have rarely run pick and rolls in the last half-decade, though that is at least in part because of Simmons’s deficiencies as a halfcourt ball-handler. Embiid also isn’t much of a vertical threat, preferring instead to roll himself into post position at the nail or on the block, where he can do damage against overmatched defenders. He’s one of the most efficient high-volume post players in the league, so that tactic has worked quite well for Philadelphia. (It remains to be seen how he’ll react when Harden goes into his tap-dance-style stepback three routine after he draws a switch, rather than dumping the ball to the big fella.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The post-centric offense occasionally turns non-Embiid Sixers into spot-up threats, though, and Harden is one of the most catch-and-shoot-averse players in the league. To wit: He has <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*harden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attempted</a> only 40 three-pointers off the catch this season, according to NBA Advanced Stats.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="9" href="#fn-9" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn&rsquo;t unusual for him: he took just 40 all of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2020-21&amp;amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;amp;dir=1&amp;amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*harden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; and only 85 &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2019-20&amp;amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;amp;dir=1&amp;amp;CF=PLAYER_NAME*E*harden&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;the year before&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-9">9</sup></a> Nine of his new Philadelphia teammates have <a href="https://www.nba.com/stats/players/catch-shoot/?Season=2021-22&amp;SeasonType=Regular%20Season&amp;PerMode=Totals&amp;sort=CATCH_SHOOT_FG3A&amp;dir=1&amp;CF=TEAM_ABBREVIATION*E*phi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taken more</a>, including Shake Milton, who has played in only 27 games. It’ll be interesting to see if he’s more willing to shoot off the catch in Philly than he was in Brooklyn.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/HardenCatch.mp4"></video></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Then there’s the defensive end of the floor. Harden has historically approached non-disaster status on defense only when involved in a switch-heavy scheme that minimized the amount of work he had to do. Philly, by contrast, rarely switches because Embiid is one of the best drop-coverage defenders in basketball — if not the best. The Sixers want to keep Embiid as close to the paint as possible within their scheme, and it makes sense for them to do that. A drop scheme means everyone else needs to be helping and recovering elsewhere on the floor. Having to do things like fight over screens or help off the wing and into the paint before jetting back out to his man on the perimeter will be a change of pace for Harden, and it remains to be seen whether he is willing to commit to doing either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And yet, both Harden and Embiid are essentially top-flight offenses unto themselves. The Sixers can stagger their minutes (assuming head coach Doc Rivers can be coaxed into avoiding his <a href="http://www.backsportspage.com/doc-rivers-and-the-all-bench-lineups/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all-bench lineups</a>) and ensure they have a <a href="https://theathletic.com/1427059/2019/12/06/the-new-nba-heliocentrism-how-teams-revolve-more-around-todays-stars-than-they-ever-have-before/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heliocentric star</a> on the court at all times. That may have an effect on Tyrese Maxey — who <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maxeyty01/gamelog/2022#72-80-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excelled</a> during the stretch Embiid missed earlier in the season due to COVID-19 and then went through an <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maxeyty01/gamelog/2022#81-87-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adjustment period</a> after Embiid came back — but the second-year guard has proved <a href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/players/m/maxeyty01/gamelog/2022#88-108-sum:pgl_basic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">capable</a> of adapting to his circumstances. Attaching Maxey and Embiid in the rotation while Harden plays more often with the better-shooting Tobias Harris makes a good degree of sense. They can then rotate Danny Green, Matisse Thybulle, Furkan Korkmaz and Georges Niang in and out to make sure there’s enough shooting and/or defense to suit the purposes of any given lineup.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This version of the Sixers also figures to turn games into free-throw contests quite often, given the penchant of both Harden and Embiid for drawing fouls. It might not be pretty, but it’ll likely be very tough to stop. It was initially reported that Harden had <a href="https://sixerswire.usatoday.com/2022/02/10/sixers-star-james-harden-will-opt-in-to-his-contract-for-2022-23-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opted into</a> his $47.4 million player option for next season as part of the deal, though subsequent <a href="https://twitter.com/KyleNeubeck/status/1492164002264371200" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reporting</a> contradicted that notion. Harden can still opt in this summer, or he can choose to opt out and re-sign on a long-term deal. Either way, the Sixers likely have a short window in which to test this out and try to win a title before things potentially become untenable with a new contract for Harden in his mid-to-late 30s.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And then there’s Brooklyn. Durant remains out with his knee injury. Irving can still play only in road games. Joe Harris <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/33211223/brooklyn-nets-joe-harris-need-second-surgery-left-ankle-agent-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may need a second surgery</a> on his left ankle. Simmons will continue to work with his therapist to <a href="https://twitter.com/ramonashelburne/status/1491841027153412096" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get mentally ready</a> to play, according to ESPN’s Ramona Shelburne, and we don’t yet know when he’ll see the floor. And the team is already in the midst of a spiral, having <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/bkn/brooklyn-nets" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lost 10 consecutive games</a> as it dealt with injury and Harden’s transparent and somewhat embarrassing efforts to get himself traded.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In theory, Simmons is an excellent fit alongside Durant and Irving. His abilities to defend multiple positions and get a team into its transition offense are incredibly valuable, particularly on a squad that can space the floor the way Brooklyn can when it has everyone healthy. He’s never been afforded the luxury of playing in all that much space because he came into the league on a team already featuring Embiid, who parked himself in the post early and often. (And with great success.) The incumbent stars’ ability to manufacture offense on their own will take pressure off of Simmons to be a lead creator — and free him to solely do the things he does well.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="10" href="#fn-10" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think we should acknowledge here that Simmons&rsquo;s decision to sit out games rather than report to the 76ers ended up getting him exactly what he wanted: He&rsquo;s no longer in Philly, but he&rsquo;s still on a contender, and he doesn&rsquo;t have to deal with being an afterthought searching for his place in Rivers&rsquo;s Embiid-centric offense. It may not have been all that professional, but you can&rsquo;t say it didn&rsquo;t work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-10">10</sup></a> It’s often been posited that Simmons could play a Draymond Green-like role in half-court offense, and it’s easy to envision him and Curry (or him and Irving) developing dribble hand-off chemistry that leverages the latter’s shooting ability and Simmons’s brilliant floor vision to bend defenses to their breaking points. (Curry remains one of the league’s best snipers, and he will help Patty Mills fill the hole Harris has left in the lineup while also providing <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nbas-best-supporting-cast-best-level-up-and-more-of-our-midseason-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more of an off-the-bounce threat</a>.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As we saw with Harden, though, there’s no guarantee that the Nets’ new star trio actually shares the floor for significant time. And without Irving, Durant or Harris in the lineup, Curry and Mills are the team&#8217;s only floor-spacers of note. (Unless you count Cam Thomas, who is always willing to shoot.) What happens if and when Simmons is on the floor in a lineup that not only isn’t particularly conducive to space, but also doesn’t have a player who can be the foundation of the halfcourt offense?&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brooklyn should be able to build a fascinating, switch-happy defense around Simmons, Durant and Nicolas Claxton, but KD’s health is no guarantee, and a Simmons-Claxton pairing might be unworkable in halfcourt offense unless at least two of the shooters are out there with them. Durant is the only plus defender among the team’s shooters, though, which means those Simmons-Claxton units might not be as potent defensively as you’d ideally want them to be. The Nets can slide Bruce Brown, James Johnson or Jevon Carter in there to help the defense, but they’re non-shooters as well, and that makes things complicated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Simmons gives the Nets the type of player they did not have last year: the guy who can guard the opposing team’s best player, regardless of position. He is one of the league’s most versatile defenders, a 6-foot-11, 240-pound wrecking ball who is capable of handling nearly any player in the league one-on-one. Among 251 players who played 1,000 or more minutes last season, he ranked fifth in Bball-Index’s Defensive Versatility metric. That wasn’t unusual: He ranked 11th in 2019-20 and second in 2018-19. He is a virtual lock to spare Durant the trouble of defending Giannis Antetokounmpo if the Nets meet the Bucks in the playoffs again, and that alone might make him worth the trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">All of this assumes Simmons is ready, able and willing to play basketball, though, and again, we do not know if or when that will happen. His youth and the two first-round picks Brooklyn received in the deal might extend the Nets’s championship window, but that window is almost certainly <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not open as wide now</a> as many expected it to be when the Nets began the season among the title favorites.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="11" href="#fn-11" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also don&rsquo;t know whether Irving, who &mdash; unlike Durant &mdash; was not signed to a contract extension last offseason, will be on the team long term. So, there&rsquo;s that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-11">11</sup></a> Given the team’s obvious ambitions when it made the Harden trade last year, that has to be disappointing.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As for Philly, this deal has to be Morey’s dream come true; he has been adamant in the past that any team with at least a <a href="https://grantland.com/features/why-teams-just-5-percent-chance-competing-nba-championship-go-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5 percent chance of winning the title</a> should be all in. With Embiid playing at an MVP level, he <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2022-nba-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rightfully believes</a> that his Sixers are in that group of teams. Rivers now has a little more than two months to figure out how best to make the Harden and Embiid pairing work. Morey’s philosophy has always been to get the stars and worry about everything else later. He’s got the stars, but now, now <em>is </em>later.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">The Super Bowl on Sunday pits an established team that’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/matthew-stafford-gave-the-rams-a-shot-at-a-title-the-rams-gave-stafford-a-shot-at-canton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gone all-in</a> against a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/joe-burrow-jamarr-chase-and-the-bengals-are-ahead-of-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hot up-and-comer</a>. There are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-bengals-slow-down-aaron-donald-nothings-stopped-him-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting matchups</a> to be found all over the field, but the most dynamic may be between each team’s star receiver: Cooper Kupp for the Los Angeles Rams vs. Ja’Marr Chase for the Cincinnati Bengals.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kupp has put together one of the best receiving seasons in NFL history, churning out steady, spectacular production for the Rams week after week. Many will point to Kupp’s 1,947 receiving yards — <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rec_yds&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second most</a> in the regular season in NFL history<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="12" href="#fn-12" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2021 was the first regular season with 17 games. Kupp’s per-game average of 114.5 receiving yards per game &lt;a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;amp;match=single&amp;amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;amp;order_by=rec_yds_per_g&amp;amp;year_min=1920&amp;amp;year_max=2021&amp;amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;amp;age_min=0&amp;amp;age_max=99&amp;amp;season_start=1&amp;amp;season_end=-1&amp;amp;height_min=0&amp;amp;height_max=99&amp;amp;weight_min=0&amp;amp;weight_max=500&amp;amp;bmi_min=0&amp;amp;bmi_max=100&amp;amp;undrafted=E&amp;amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;amp;draft_type=B&amp;amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;amp;conference=any&amp;amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;ranks 11th all-time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-12">12</sup></a> as proof of his greatness. Others might nod to his consistency: Kupp posted fewer than 90 yards receiving in just <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/K/KuppCo00/gamelog/2021/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two games out of 20</a> this season. But perhaps most impressive was his efficiency. Kupp’s 3.28 receiving yards per route run from Week 1 through the playoffs ranks second among qualifying receivers since 2007,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="13" href="#fn-13" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first year for which we have data. Qualified receivers have at least 15 routes per team game in a given season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-13">13</sup></a> and his share of receptions on routes run (23.9 percent) is fourth among qualifying receivers<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="14" href="#fn-14" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among players with at least two receptions per game in a given season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-14">14</sup></a> over those 15 seasons.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, Kupp won where you would expect him to win. He racked up more of his catches on short-to-intermediate outside routes than any other area of the field. He led the league in receptions on short outs — routes that break sharply to the sideline — hauling in 47 of his 170 receptions<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="15" href="#fn-15" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regular season and playoffs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-15">15</sup></a> there this season. Kupp made the catches count, too: He converted 22 into first downs, tops in the NFL. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Again, this really <a href="https://twitter.com/NFL/status/1332866872497287168?s=20&amp;t=R1eUHIzJp-sS3HsCxdXzKg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">isn’t much of a surprise</a> to anyone who has followed Kupp’s career. He’s well-known for his sharp route running, and he possesses an ability to patiently read the leverage of his defenders, then quickly change direction and break their ankles when they overcommit.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">On the opposing sideline, Chase is known primarily as the opposite of Kupp: a deep threat that you can’t afford to leave singled up without help on the outside. The first-year sensation’s success running verts is a large part of the reason why he averaged the <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rec_yds_per_g&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eighth-most yards per game</a> ever for a rookie and compiled the <a href="https://stathead.com/football/psl_finder.cgi?request=1&amp;match=single&amp;order_by_asc=0&amp;order_by=rec_yds&amp;year_min=1920&amp;year_max=2021&amp;positions%5B%5D=wr&amp;age_min=0&amp;age_max=99&amp;season_start=1&amp;season_end=-1&amp;height_min=0&amp;height_max=99&amp;weight_min=0&amp;weight_max=500&amp;bmi_min=0&amp;bmi_max=100&amp;undrafted=E&amp;draft_year_min=1936&amp;draft_year_max=2021&amp;draft_type=B&amp;draft_slot_min=1&amp;draft_slot_max=500&amp;draft_pick_in_round=pick_overall&amp;conference=any&amp;seasons_comp=%3D&amp;seasons_val=-1&amp;pro_bowls_comp=%3D&amp;pro_bowls_val=-1&amp;all_pros_first_team_comp=%3D&amp;all_pros_first_team_val=-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-most receiving yards</a> for a first-year receiver in NFL history.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="16" href="#fn-16" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Again, over a 17-game regular season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-16">16</sup></a> It’s hard to think of Chase this season and not recall one of the many plays on which he just flat-out beat his opponent in a footrace to the end zone.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/deep-td2.mp4"></video></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Chase was second in the league with 26 catches on vertical routes, racking up 758 yards while streaking upfield, often against defenders caught flat-footed trying to cover him deep one-on-one. His reputation is well-deserved. But if Chase was second in vertical success, which receiver was first? The (perhaps) surprising answer: Kupp.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Kupp bested Chase in every statistical category deep, catching 28 balls for 857 yards. And that’s to take nothing away from Chase — there really weren’t any areas of the field where either receiver was a liability for their teams this year. It’s just that Kupp was so very good, well, everywhere.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="1058" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png" alt="" class="wp-image-325408" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hermsmeyer.kupp-vs-chase-1.png?w=1400 2x"></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The sheer volume of short and intermediate routes the Rams ask Kupp to run is impressive enough, but head coach Sean McVay also lines Kupp up in so many locations that it’s hard to know what’s coming and when. Kupp attacked from the outside, from the slot, from bunch formations, after coming in motion, on choice routes where he lags behind and waits to make a decision on where to make his break, and even from the backfield. So perhaps it’s forgivable that when he puts his head down and sprints for the end zone, teams are taken by surprise.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/kupp-vert3.mp4"></video></figure><p data-paragraph="main">With Odell Beckham Jr. and Van Jefferson threatening deep when Kupp goes short, the defense is put in a no-win situation. And perhaps because of the bind he puts coverages in, Kupp was incredibly efficient deep: On passes between 30 and 40 yards in the air, Kupp caught 7 of 8 targets for 317 yards and a touchdown.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Surely none of this is lost on the Bengals. Forced to choose whether to suffer a death by a thousand Kupps or risk getting beat over the top for a quick score, it’s likely Cincinnati will want to try to dictate the action at some point in Super Bowl LVI and bring pressure. But compounding the problem for the Bengals defense is that quarterback Matthew Stafford has built excellent chemistry with Kupp. Stafford has learned to anticipate his receiver’s reads, and he seems to trust him to make big plays, particularly when looking down the barrel of a blitz. Stafford scored an incredible 93.7 QBR — best in the league — against the blitz from Week 1 through the playoffs. Throws like this one to Kupp help explain his success.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-video"><video controls src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/stafford-trust.mp4"></video></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Chase’s Bengals are a scrapy young team — young enough that they should be good for years to come — and many people will be rooting for them. But with Kupp in his prime and playing at a historic level with seemingly no weaknesses, it’s difficult to imagine a scenario where Cincinnati defensive coordinator Lou Anarumo will be able to come up with enough answers to effectively contain him. Thanks to Kupp, the Rams’ all-in gamble this season looks likely to pay off.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.cantorsparadise.com/trapezoidal-numbers-586b6d1fb03a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trapezoidal</a> numbers are whole numbers that can be written as the sum of two or more consecutive positive integers. For example, 9 is a trapezoidal number because it can be written as 2+3+4. In fact, 9 is <em>doubly </em>trapezoidal because it can also be written as 4+5. (By the way, <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/TriangularNumber.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">triangular</a> numbers are also trapezoidal.

<h2 id="solution-to-last-week-s-riddler-express">Solution to last week’s Riddler Express</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Congratulations to <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f44f.png" alt="👏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Malcolm Gray <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/13.1.0/72x72/1f44f.png" alt="👏" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> of Cambridge, winner of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/a-riddle-that-will-make-you-scream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last week’s Riddler Express</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, you analyzed an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/01/21/briefing/news-quiz-biden-speech-microsoft-video-games.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online quiz</a> that asked which three actors from the original “Scream” movie had returned for the fifth installment of the franchise. There were five choices:</p>



<ul><li>Courteney Cox</li><li>David Arquette</li><li>Halle Berry</li><li>Neve Campbell</li><li>Tom Holland</li></ul><p data-paragraph="main">For the sake of the problem, you supposed that you had no clue about any of these actors.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you randomly chose three of the five actors, what was the probability that you would have gotten at least two right?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One way to figure this out was to first compute the total number of ways to choose three of the actors. Since the order of your selections didn’t matter, this was 5 <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/Combination.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">choose</a> 3, or 10.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of those 10 ways to choose three actors, only one of them got all three correct. But how many ways were there to get precisely <em>two</em> correct? There were three different pairs of correct actors you could have identified (Cox and Arquette, Cox and Campbell, and Arquette and Campbell). For each of those three pairs, there were two incorrect actors to choose from (Berry and Holland). In other words, there were 3 times 2, or six, ways to get exactly two actors right.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With seven ways to correctly identify <em>at least</em> two actors out of a 10 ways to choose any three, the answer was <strong>70 percent</strong>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Another approach, used by the students in The Problem Solving &amp; Posing Class at New York City’s Hewitt School, was to count up how many of the 10 cases resulted in you getting only one actor correct. (Note that you couldn’t get all three wrong.) You could choose any one of the three correct actors, and then you had to select both incorrect actors along with them. So of the 10 ways to choose three actors, three ways resulted in you <em>not</em> getting at least two right. Once again, the answer was 70 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, I will say that several readers, including Amy from Wayland, Massachusetts and Rick Wingo from Austin, Texas, pointed out that Tom Holland was born only months before the release of the original Scream film. He clearly was not a correct choice. But now I can’t get the image of a newborn Tom Holland in a Ghostface costume out of my head.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Last week, I had a light source that was polarized in the vertical direction, but I wanted it to be polarized in the horizontal direction. To make that happen I needed … polarizers! When light passes through a polarizer, only the light whose polarization aligns with the polarizer passes through. When they aren’t perfectly aligned, only the <em>component</em> of the light that’s in the direction of the polarizer passes through.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Unfortunately, that meant I couldn’t turn vertically polarized light into horizontally polarized light with a single polarizer. But I <em>could</em> do it with two polarizers, as shown below.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Now, I had tons of polarizers, and each one also reflected 1 percent of any light that hit it — no matter its polarization or orientation — while polarizing the remaining 99 percent of the light.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I wanted to horizontally polarize as much of the incoming light as possible. How many polarizers should I have used?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">First of all, how much light could you horizontally polarize with <em>two</em> polarizers? If the first polarizer was an angle 𝜃 from vertical, then the second polarizer had to be 90°−𝜃 from the first polarizer. Assuming no reflection (for now), that meant the component of the light getting through was cos(𝜃)·cos(90°−𝜃). This function was maximized when 𝜃 was 45°, meaning the two polarizers evenly split the 90° angle into two 45° angles.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That was when you had two polarizers. What about <em>N</em> polarizers? Once again, your best strategy is to evenly divide the 90° angle into <em>N </em>equal angles, each measuring 90°/<em>N</em>. Several solvers went on to prove this in different ways: <a href="https://laurentlessard.com/bookproofs/polarization-puzzle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Laurent Lessard</a> with Jensen’s inequality, <a href="https://twitter.com/ptrajeev/status/1490646137878966272" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rajeev Pakalapati</a> with induction and <a href="https://www.starvind.com/math/polarizing-puzzler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Arvind Hariharan</a> with a symmetry argument. With <em>N</em> evenly spaced polarizers, the final horizontal component was cos<em><sup>N</sup></em>(90°/<em>N</em>).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now before we go any further, let’s say a little more about light. Up to this point, the vectors I‘ve referred to are the electric field vectors of the light. However, the <em>intensity</em> of the light is proportional to the <em>square</em> of the magnitude of this electric field vector. When it came to positioning the polarizers, this didn’t matter — maximizing the electric field was effectively the same as maximizing its square. However, this ambiguity affected your interpretation of the fact that 1 percent of the light was reflected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Most readers interpreted this as meaning that the electric field vector attenuated by 1 percent with each polarizer. In this case, the final horizontal component was (0.99)<em><sup>N</sup></em>·cos<em><sup>N</sup></em>(90°/<em>N</em>). Thanks to the exponent on the cosine function, this function does some strange things when <em>N</em> is less than 1. But when <em>N</em> was greater than 1, the maximum occurred when <em>N</em> was approximately 11.135. Since you had to have an integer number of polarizers, the optimal number turned out to be <strong>11</strong>, in which case the horizontal component was about 80 percent of the original vertical component.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Other readers interpreted the puzzle as saying the light’s <em>intensity</em> was attenuated by 1 percent with each polarizer. Since the intensity was proportional to the square of the electric field, this meant the final horizontal component was (0.99)<em><sup>N</sup></em><sup>/2</sup>·cos<em><sup>N</sup></em>(90°/<em>N</em>). This time around, the maximum occurred when <em>N</em> was approximately 15.708. The optimal (integer) number of polarizers was <strong>16</strong>, in which case the horizontal component was about 85.42 percent of the original vertical component.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If you thought two interpretations of the puzzle weren’t enough, then worry not. Solver Joao Coelho had a <em>third</em> interpretation, where the light that wasn’t transmitted by each polarizer was reflected back to the previous polarizer, and could bounce back and forth internally multiple times. According to Joao, accounting for these internal reflections allowed you to squeeze in one more polarizer.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main" class="has-drop-cap">In 1902, a 20-year-old figure skater from England named Madge Syers showed up somewhere that no official from the International Skating Union expected her to be: center ice at the world championships. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Though figure skating competitions were hardly a new thing — they took place throughout the latter half of the 19th century — a formal world championship in the discipline had only been created in 1896. And up until Syers’s appearance, the only entrants had ever been men. Madge and her husband, Edgar, also a figure skater with whom she competed in pairs, realized that there was no explicit rule that prevented her from entering the event, which was to be held in London. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Loophole, meet Madge. She went ahead and entered.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The field was quite small, as they tended to be in those days; of the four competitors, Syers placed second, taking the silver behind Ulrich Salchow, who was at the beginning of a competitive run that would result in <a href="https://olympics.com/en/athletes/ulrich-salchow" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10 world titles</a> and one Olympic gold medal.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="18" href="#fn-18" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The name “Salchow” might sound familiar even to those who watch figure skating only during the Olympics because the Swedish skater innovated an edge jump that is still in use, albeit with more revolutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-18">18</sup></a> Syers — skating in her long black skirt, satin blouse, pearls, leather gloves and hat — impressed everyone, including Salchow himself, who, as legend has it, presented his gold medal to her. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the next ISU Congress, when the issue of women competing against men came up, members decided to make explicit what had previously only been implicit: Women were not allowed to compete at the world championships. According to the British delegate to the ISU,<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="19" href="#fn-19" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British were in the minority advocating for women to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-19">19</sup></a> the group’s reasoning was threefold: First, the dress “prevents the judges from seeing the feet.” Second, a judge might “judge a girl to whom he was attached.” And third, “it is difficult to compare women with men.” (Why a “lady” athlete potentially arousing libidinous feelings in a male judge is an excuse to keep women out of sport rather than the other way around is a question as old as time.) </p>

She and her husband, Edgar, won the bronze medal in pairs at the 1908 Olympics. <p class="photo-credit credits">ullstein bild / S&amp;G / PA Images / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">In response, Syers raised the hem of her skirt to midcalf and went on to win the British figure skating championship in the International Style<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="20" href="#fn-20" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First prize was the Swedish Cup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-20">20</sup></a> in 1903 — and again in 1904, when she retained her title by defeating Edgar, who placed second. (She also entered the European Championships in 1904 but had to withdraw after the figures due to injury.) By 1906, the ISU, at the urging of the British, had created a women’s category — or “ladies” category, as it was called <a href="https://www.insidethegames.biz/articles/1109826/isu-ladies-women-council-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">until just last year</a><a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="21" href="#fn-21" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And still is by U.S. Figure Skating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-21">21</sup></a> — though until 1924, the winner of the women’s title wasn’t considered a world champion.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="22" href="#fn-22" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And even after 1924, “lady” was used as a modifier while male winners were simply “world champions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-22">22</sup></a> Syers dominated the new women’s event and won the <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/event_names/300" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first women’s Olympic gold medal</a> in figure skating in 1908 alongside Salchow, who picked up the first men’s Olympic title in the discipline. (Syers also won the <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/results/12542" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pairs bronze</a> with Edgar.) Syers retired from competition shortly thereafter due to poor health; she died from heart failure a week before her 36th birthday. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The story of Syers and her bold move to enter what was understood to be a men’s-only event all the way back in 1902 is worth knowing in and of itself. But it’s interesting to consider Syers’s story in the context of our current “crisis” over trans women competing in the women’s category. The way that so-called defenders of women’s sports talk, the women’s sporting categories exist to ensure that women have the opportunity to win medals, and if we let trans women compete, we are going to destroy women’s sports. </p>


<p>Watch: https://abcnews.go.com/fivethirtyeight/video/hard-community-crucial-reach-olympics-82724511</p>


<p data-paragraph="main">What happened with Syers complicates this narrative. In the case of figure skating, the women’s category was created because this was the only way the powers that be would let them participate. This wasn’t about giving women opportunities to medal; women were explicitly excluded <em>after </em>Syers had proven herself more than medal-worthy. The creation of the women’s figure skating category wasn’t a gift bestowed on women. It was a consolation prize. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The inclusion of women in other athletic disciplines was also met with resistance. In the 1920s, after failing to persuade the International Olympic Committee and the International Amateur Athletic Federation to include track and field events for women in the Olympics, Alice Milliat created the Fédération Sportive Féminine Internationale, the institution behind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women%27s_World_Games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Women’s World Games</a>. The women’s track and field competition was a huge success, <a href="https://digital.la84.org/digital/collection/p17103coll10/id/85/rec/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attracting around 20,000 spectators</a> to its first iteration in 1922, then a one-day event. It was the success of Milliat and the FSFI, not the International Olympic Committee’s desire to create opportunities for female athletes, that led to the inclusion of women’s track and field at the Olympics. The IOC, resigned to the existence of women’s sport, decided that it was preferable for them, and not some other renegade organization, to be in charge. They didn’t like the idea of women running and jumping and sweating, but they liked the idea of women controlling their own sporting events even less. </p>

We treat this arrangement not only as the way it has always been, but as the only way it could ever possibly be. But when Syers skated onto the ice in 1902, the idea of a separate category for female athletes in all sports wasn’t a foregone conclusion because women’s participation in high-level international competition also wasn’t a foregone conclusion. Women’s sport was still negotiating its right to exist, female athletes the right to participate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Probably owing to the newly imposed gender segregation, and the fact that early on it could be performed by women wearing Victorian-era attire, figure skating was one of the first Olympic sports open to women.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="23" href="#fn-23" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founder of the modern Olympic movement, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, wasn’t exactly a fan of the idea of women competing in sports at all. In all likelihood he thought their role would be better suited to placing wreaths on the heads of the male medalists instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-23">23</sup></a> Just two years after the women’s-only category was created by the ISU, men’s and women’s figure skating were added to the 1908 Olympics, in addition to men’s figures and pairs. (Pairs placed a man and a woman together, but as long as they were performing their heteronormative roles, that appeared to pass muster.) Figure skating was the very <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/every-olympic-sport-in-one-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first “winter” sport</a> added to the Olympic program at a time when there was not yet a separate event for winter sports.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The creation of the ladies category, however, didn’t relegate the women to second-class status as it did in many other sports — even if for many years, the winner of the women’s category wasn’t technically considered a world champion. “The ladies did the same compulsory figures as the men, and because there were no required elements in free skating, program content was neither dictated nor limited by gender,” James R. Hines wrote in “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Figure-Skating-Formative-Years-Expanding/dp/0252039068/ref=sr_1_7?crid=2EHKGM0J8HCZX&amp;keywords=figure+skating&amp;qid=1641939240&amp;rnid=283155&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=figure+skating%2Cstripbooks%2C316&amp;sr=1-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Figure Skating in the Formative Years: Singles, Pairs, and the Expanding Role of Women</a>.” He noted that the only thing that held the women back technically in those days was their traditionally feminine and modest attire. They had nothing to lose but their long skirts. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-56765258-575.jpg" alt="The medalists in women’s figure skating at the 1924 Winter Olympics" class="wp-image-325267" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-56765258-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-56765258-575.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-56765258-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-56765258-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-56765258-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The medalists in women’s figure skating at the 1924 Winter Olympics, from left: Herma Planck-Szabo of Austria, who won gold; Ethel Muckelt of Britain, bronze; and Beatrix Loughran of the U.S., silver. <p class="photo-credit credits">Topical Press Agency / Hulton Archive / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">Even without radically different rules in place, at least at first, it’s not exactly true that the men’s and women’s disciplines co-evolved in precisely the same way. In subjectively judged aesthetic sports like figure skating and gymnastics, athletes aren’t simply performing the most difficult elements they can pull off with the best possible technique they can manage; they’re often enacting traditional ideas about masculinity and femininity. With gymnastics, this divide is quite stark: The men and women ended up with completely different apparatuses, with only minor overlap (floor, vault) between them. With figure skating, since the men and women are doing the same elements on the very same ice, things like costuming, music choice and choreography became the way the distinctions between male and female, masculine and feminine are made. And just as the meanings of masculinity and femininity have shifted over time, so too have the figure skating performances meant to evince those qualities. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Over the past century, men’s and women’s skating have diverged, converged, diverged and then converged again. The dividing line placed between the two disciplines was never a brick wall but a porous membrane that has allowed one discipline to influence the other. But given the prominence of women’s figure skating, particularly in the West, it has been the women — shunted off to their own category at the turn of the 20th century — who have helped shape the popular image of the sport. </p>

She looks like a real woman on the ice,” Baiul told Katarina Witt, the 1984 and 1988 Olympic champion. “We must skate as women on the ice.” Baiul, who would win that competition at only 15 years old and then win gold a year later at the Lillehammer Olympics, was likely emphasizing “woman” because she herself was so young, and Trenary’s style, which exemplified an adult femininity, was clearly something she aspired to in her performances. Typically in sports, doing anything like “a girl” — running, throwing, punching, breathing — is suggestive of doing a sport in a less than ideal way because the ideal way is the “masculine” way, whatever that means. This is not the case for women’s figure skating. Skating as a “woman,” whatever that means at a particular point in time, is part of a job. And for years, the task of the men was to look at their female counterparts and make sure that their skating was markedly different.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The difference between the men’s and women’s approaches to figure skating was particularly evident in the performances at the 1968 Olympics, when American Peggy Fleming won the gold. On the men’s side, Tim Wood from the U.S. took second with a very different kind of performance. Where Fleming was balletic and feminine, with her arms raised above her head, rounded and soft, Wood’s arms never went above shoulder height; they were stiff like the blades of a propeller. His upper body was mostly rigid; all the movement was coming from his feet, while Fleming showed off her flexibility, arching her back in a layback spin and extending her leg upward in a spiral. And then there were the costumes. Wood was dressed in conventional blue, his costume unadorned. Fleming was wearing a chartreuse skating dress, also unbaubled — this was before skating’s bedazzled era began. (Fleming noted that <a href="https://olympics.com/en/featured-news/peggy-fleming-1968-grenoble-artistry-figure-skating" target="_blank" rel="noopener">her mother chose this color</a> because she thought it would endear the 19-year-old skater to the French audience in Grenoble, as it referenced the French liqueur by the same name.) While both Fleming and Wood did many of the same elements, save for the triple jumps that <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-quad-jump-revolution-has-transformed-womens-figure-skating-how-far-will-it-go/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weren’t yet part</a> of the average woman’s skating program, they performed them and the choreography around them in a distinctly gendered way.</p>

In fact, it was quite typical. In “Artistic Impressions: Figure Skating, Masculinity and the Limits of Sport,” Mary Louise Adams wrote that the style that had come to typify men’s skating in the postwar period was a deliberate attempt by athlete and official alike to counter the feminine associations the sport had accrued, especially after the long reign of Norway’s Sonja Henie, who became the most recognizable skater in the world after her three Olympic golds and her successful foray into Hollywood films. “They tried to fashion for <em>men’s</em> skating a new identity as an athletically demanding, clearly defined sport,” Adams wrote of the men’s skating style that emerged in the 1940s and ’50s. It was during this time that American Dick Button, the <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/84513" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1948 and 1952 Olympic gold medalist</a>, performed the first double axel jump in competition, as well as the first triple toe loop. There was beauty in the men’s skating, to be sure, but it was the kind of beauty borne of deep edges and perfectly held upright carriages. It’s the beauty of technique but not of feeling and expression.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But by the mid-’70s, this rigid style of performance was changing, largely due to the efforts of John Curry of Great Britain and Toller Cranston of Canada — the 1976 Olympic <a href="https://www.olympedia.org/results/13362" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gold and bronze medalists</a>, respectively.  </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Curry brought a classical ballet mien to his programs. He used his arms fully to express the music and extended his legs. Initially quite weak at figures — which while not as important in 1973, was still part of the final score — he worked with school figures master Carlo Fassi, who had coached Fleming and Dorothy Hamill to Olympic gold medals. To tackle his weakness as a jumper, he worked with Gus Lussi. By 1976, he was the best at the world championships and Olympics. </p>

Unable to overcome his weakness in the figures, Cranston never won the major international titles that Curry did despite occasionally besting the Brit in the free skate. He hit more unusual shapes than Curry did, and he performed skills like layback spins that demanded greater flexibility, which were typically seen as the domain of the women skaters. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“They understood their music, they attended to the fine details of body line, and they certainly did not allow prevailing notions of masculinity to curtail their creativity,” Adams wrote of Curry and Cranston. “As a consequence, they both struggled throughout their careers to gain acceptance in a sport that had grown aesthetically timid in the face of narrow but popular ideas of how male bodies should move and perform in public.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Tollerance-Intimate-Revolutionized-Skating/dp/0771023340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero Tollerance: An Intimate Memoir by the Man Who Revolutionized Figure Skating</a>,” Cranston spoke of the resistance he had encountered when he brought his baroque style to the ice. “In the days when men dressed up as maître d’s, skated their long programs in shirts, ties, and tiny matador jackets, and were not allowed to raise their hands above their shoulders, I was a renegade,” he wrote. “I invented beads on men’s costumes. I invented décolleté. Everything I did was new, different, and shocking to the Old Guard, and I was punished for it.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg" alt="The men’s medalists in 1976" class="wp-image-325263" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/AP7602110269-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>The men’s medalists in 1976, from left: Vladimir Kovalyov of the USSR, who won silver; John Curry of Great Britain, gold; and Toller Cranston of Canada, bronze. <p class="photo-credit credits">AP Photo</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">While he and Curry were able to win medals — in Curry’s case more than a few — this didn’t stop those in the skating community from signaling their displeasure with the male skaters’ style. As Adams recounted, “In the days before computerized marking, Curry faced judges who, in protest against his style, refused to lift their scorecards higher than their shoulders.” I guess the men weren’t supposed to raise their arms above shoulder height on the ice or off. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s very clear that the resistance to Curry and Cranston’s on-ice style was due to their perceived violation of gender norms. Said one TV announcer when talking about Ron Shaver, a Canadian teammate of Cranston’s: “Now we will see more of a male performance.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Adams cited a German writer who wrote this about the two in a book recapping the 1976 Winter Olympics: “If either the handsome Toller or the graceful John had worn a small skirt they could have become the best female skater of this year’s winter games. … Never before have men skated so femininely.” What this writer is pointedly saying is that there is functionally no difference between the performances of the women and those of Curry and Cranston other than costuming. And what they’re acknowledging is that the distinction between men’s and women’s skating is largely a performative one, not an athletic one. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In most sports, the direction of influence goes from the men to the women, not the other way around. The men are viewed as the innovators in athletic disciplines, with women, who were often not allowed to participate until well after the sport had established itself, playing what feels like an eternal game of catch-up. But in figure skating, women have been there from the earliest days; many old paintings of skating feature women on ice, often skating together with men. While there was resistance to women’s participation in a head-to-head style of competition against men — see: Syers, Madge — women have been around skating as long as their male counterparts. You can put them into a separate category, but their influence will still be felt, just as the influence of the men can be seen in the women’s programs. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And male skaters like Cranston felt quite comfortable acknowledging the contributions of female skaters. In the 1975 book “Toller” by Elva Oglanby, Cranston is quite effusive in his praise of U.S. figure skater Janet Lynn, who was considered the best free skater of the time despite having never won a world or Olympic title. (Like Cranston, Lynn was a weak school figures skater.) “She has a quality about her that almost defies description. There is something almost mystical in the way she moves, the flow of her hair, the delicate motion of her arms, the dream-like fluidity. She is a beautiful wraith. … I sincerely believe that Janet Lynn is the greatest female skater the world has ever seen,” Cranston said.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Curry’s and Cranston’s impact on the sport was almost immediate. In his commentary over American Scott Cramer’s 1977 long program at the U.S. national championships, Dick Button acknowledges that. “He’s a young man who’s changed his style completely very recently. He’s much influenced by Toller Cranston now. He’s loosened up his style of performing,” Button said. “I think it’s rather refreshing to see some of the freedom that has come into the sport of figure skating as a result of recent years.” In the opening moments of his long program, Cramer lifts his arms above his head, a small but significant sign that men’s figure skating had changed. </p>

Cranston wrote about how he was the one to bring beads to men’s skating costumes, but he wasn’t really the person to get the sparkle trend in figure skating going. “In a disco-fied era that became as known for its glitter and sparkle as it was for its music, the rhinestones and beads that adorned many a nightlife outfit soon found their way to skating costumes,” Kelli Lawrence wrote in “Skating on Air: The Broadcast History of an Olympic Marquee Sport.” “[Linda] Fratianne is often considered the one who sparkled first, and quite literally, sparkled brightest.” Fratianne burst onto the scene with her sparkles (and her triple jumps), and though she didn’t medal in Innsbruck — Hamill took the gold there — by the time the 1977 world championships rolled around, she was the best in the world. And soon, everyone else was going HAM with the bedazzler too. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Naturally, there was a backlash to this trend, particularly for the men. Scott Hamilton, before he became a four-time world champion and 1984 Olympic gold medalist, asked a reporter at a 1982 world championships press conference, “When are you guys going to start treating us like athletes?” The reporter responded, “When you guys stop dressing like Liberace!” It seemed that the reporter’s primary gripe with male skaters wasn’t about what they did on the ice, be it athletic or artistic, but about how they looked. The journalist was defining “sport” on the basis of appearance. (It’s also hard to miss the homophobia in the reporter’s comment.) After that, Hamilton started wearing what were essentially speedskating suits. “The professionals emphasize the artistic side of figure skating, and that’s fine. But as long as we’re an Olympic sport, I think the emphasis in the amateur ranks should be on the athletic side,” Hamilton said. He seems to be drawing the line between art and sport with attire, not with style of movement, as had been the concern of critics of Curry and Cranston in the ’70s, or of music choice. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1150" height="767" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-450777727-575.jpg" alt="Scott Hamilton" class="wp-image-325268" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-450777727-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-450777727-575.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-450777727-575.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-450777727-575.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-450777727-575.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Scott Hamilton, center, eschewed the embellished costumes that had taken hold in the men’s competition. Hamilton, who won gold in 1984, is flanked by silver medalist Brian Orser, left, and bronze medalist Jozef Sabovčík. <p class="photo-credit credits">David Madison / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">The women’s athleticism has also been eclipsed by how they dress. Nancy Kerrigan was generally talked about in terms of her bearing and appearance — she wore beautiful, elegant skating outfits designed by Vera Wang. But Kerrigan was actually an athletic skater. She was competing triple-triple jump combinations well before they had become the norm in women’s figure skating — just in a really nice dress. Unlike for the men, this image helped Kerrigan with sponsors and the general public. The evolution of women’s skating costumes has enabled greater athleticism while still coding them as feminine, which made their athletic feats “acceptable.” The same thing happened for the men — the costumes obscured the skaters’ athleticism — but this was not viewed as a desirable outcome for the male skaters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The anxiety over masculinity that was still palpable in the ’80s and ’90s appears to have subsided considerably today. Some men skate in simple, relatively unadorned outfits; others prefer a tad more sparkle or flash. These sartorial preferences are far less remarked upon than they once had been. This feels a bit like progress. But the tension over the gendered lines of figure skating remains. You can see that from the reaction to Canadian male singles skater Keegan Messing wearing white boots in practice at the recent Canadian national championships. Since the late 1920s, women have worn white boots, following in the great Sonja Henie’s bootsteps. Up until then, both men and women wore black boots. (Henie, upon realizing that all the women had copied her style, started wearing beige boots.) The reaction to Messing’s choice wasn’t negative, but the fact that a man wearing a white boot on the ice was even a little noteworthy shows how these superficial distinctions between men’s and women’s skating still matter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="2048" height="1366" src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg" alt="Jason Brown" class="wp-image-325273" srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x" data-src="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg" data-srcset="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=700 1x, https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/GettyImages-1369344062-1024.jpg?w=1400 2x"><figcaption>Men’s skaters like Jason Brown are emphasizing the artistic elements that had been associated more with women’s skating. <p class="photo-credit credits">Jean Catuffe / Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p data-paragraph="main">As the technical gap between men’s and women’s skating continues to narrow, very minor aesthetic differences are all that remain to distinguish the men’s event from the women’s. At these Games, Russian Kamila Valieva became the first female skater to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hda3vvmqQHQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">perform a quad jump</a> in Olympic competition — though that accomplishment has been complicated by the reports that she <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/33256776/olympics-2022-know-russian-figure-skater-kamila-valieva-alleged-positive-drug-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tested positive</a> for a banned substance, putting her Olympics in jeopardy.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="24" href="#fn-24" data-footnote-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the recent &lt;a href="https://results.isu.org/events/gprus2021_Women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener"&gt;Rostelecom Cup&lt;/a&gt;, Valieva outscored the men’s winner even though she was barred from doing quads in her short program; if she had been allowed to add a quad jump to her short program, her overall point total could have been even higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;'><sup id="ss-24">24</sup></a> While the men are still ahead of the women in jumps, the women are gaining ground, and given that upgrading to quintuple jumps seems essentially impossible — with the structural limits of boots, blades and the human body — it’s only a matter of time until the women pull up alongside men in this regard. And on the artistic side of the sport, the men have pulled in line with women already; men like <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/jason-brown-may-not-land-a-quad-jump-in-beijing-his-fans-dont-need-him-to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">American Jason Brown</a> are performing gorgeous spirals reminiscent of Kerrigan’s iconic pose in the ’90s and Sasha Cohen’s extension and flexibility in the early aughts. Men’s step sequences are every inch as intricate and expressive as those of the women. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But still, despite this seeming convergence, men and women compete in separate categories, unless they’re competing in pairs or ice dance, in which case they’re generally tasked with enacting <a href="https://deadspin.com/what-makes-ice-dancing-different-brother-sister-pairs-1823041001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heteronormative ideals</a> (with the exception of the <a href="https://time.com/5155292/maia-alex-shibutani-skating-siblings-olympics-2018/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shibutani siblings</a>). What it means to be a man or a woman on the ice might have shifted to some degree, but you still have to be one or the other, which leaves skaters like Timothy LeDuc, a pairs skater representing the U.S., in quite a bind: LeDuc <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/sports/olympics/2022/02/04/openly-nonbinary-athlete-timothy-leduc-iowa-figure-skating-winter-olympics-2022-history/9291432002/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">came out publicly as nonbinary</a> last year, but they still have to perform the male partner’s elements on ice, which means doing the lifts and throws. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Cranston wrote about the tension of gendered movement in his memoir: “I was uninhibited in a day when lack of inhibition was virtually unknown; uninhibited in interpretation, original moves, and body language — which I felt was inherently neither male nor female.” Cranston saw his performance on the ice as almost genderless; he was simply an expressive being. It was the viewers who decided to gender the moves he did with his body as female, and then to perceive him as being in violation of norms, the same way that ISU officials, over half a century before Cranston took to Olympic ice, looked at moves Syers did and decided that they, too, were inappropriate for a woman. In his case, it was the manner of expression, and in hers, it was the context of the movement — in direct competition with men. The failures weren’t theirs but ours — of being unable to imagine any other world might be possible, if only through sport. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p data-paragraph="main">Welcome to <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/tag/pollapalooza/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pollapalooza</a>, our weekly polling roundup.</p>



<div class="ornamental-rule"><hr><span></span></div>




<p data-paragraph="main">Interested in who’s going to win the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Ohio in a few months? Well, we’ve got good news and bad news for you. The good news is that there are already 22 polls of the race! But the bad news is that 21 of them are <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-don-blankenship-really-surging-in-west-virginia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal polls</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Internal polls are polls sponsored by either a candidate running in the race or an outside group that has endorsed one of the candidates. In other words, these are polls that have an agenda behind them — and that agenda is usually to make their preferred candidate look good. As a result, they are usually too good to be true for their sponsor. FiveThirtyEight editor-in-chief Nate Silver <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-you-shouldnt-always-trust-the-inside-scoop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found in 2017</a> that internal and partisan polls conducted during the last three weeks of U.S. House general elections overstated their party’s candidate by an average of 4 or 5 percentage points.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This poses a serious problem for people (like us) just trying to get an honest read of a race — especially if internal polls are all (or most) of what we have to go off. And unfortunately, that’s not just the case in Ohio this year; it’s true in primaries nationwide. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We hunted down every poll we could find of 2022’s Senate, House and governor primaries (as of Feb. 10 at 3 p.m. Eastern), and a majority of them (at least 118 out of 229) are internal polls. And while we have polling data for a healthy 78 primaries so far (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s good</a>), that polling is 100 percent internal in 23 of those primaries (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i73-lpVV-Jo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that’s bad</a>).</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">For an example of how internal polls can mislead, look no further than that Ohio Senate race. The Republican primary is a crowded affair with tons of undecided voters, creating an opportunity for several candidates to claim they’re doing well. For example, the campaign of former state Treasurer Josh Mandel recently released a <a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMandelOhio/status/1488960353115557892?s=20&amp;t=i5bdn_zQDgv1e-zqvGlFHA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WPA Intelligence poll</a> that gave himself 28 percent and businessman Mike Gibbons 17 percent. But a <a href="https://twitter.com/JacobRubashkin/status/1488636017775104000?s=20&amp;t=gu_Uv7h-MDs-ZAobqvz5iA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cygnal poll</a> conducted for Gibbons around the same time put Gibbons at 16 percent and Mandel at only 13 percent.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Meanwhile, in early January, a <a href="https://twitter.com/JaneTimkenOH/status/1479426941971218433?s=20&amp;t=zGwbEHe1WPt8przQrAeHUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Moore Information Group survey</a> for former Ohio GOP Chair Jane Timken trumpeted that Timken was “statistically tied” with Mandel, 16 percent to 18 percent. And back in October, a <a href="https://twitter.com/politicoalex/status/1451212523873751042?s=20&amp;t=hXHa4vxgB-J7w3za5PRC6g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fabrizio Lee poll</a> for a super PAC supporting author J.D. Vance similarly put Vance (16 percent) in a strong second place behind Mandel (19 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, these polls are all telling their own stories. But that doesn’t mean they’re totally useless. For instance, the fact that Mandel leads in even a couple of his opponents’ polls suggests that he is a front-runner. (The <a href="https://www.thetrafalgargroup.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/TRF-OH-22-GOP-Primary-1216-Poll-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">only independent poll</a> of the race, conducted in December by the Trafalgar Group, concurs: It showed Mandel at 21 percent, Vance at 15 percent, Gibbons at 12 percent and Timken at 10 percent.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Likewise, internal polls’ trendlines can often be useful. For instance, in <a href="https://www.politico.com/f/?id=0000017e-d5b6-de19-a97e-f5b7f15e0000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two Fabrizio Lee polls</a> since October, Vance has slumped to 10 percent and 9 percent, suggesting he is losing support over time. (In fact, it’s likely that these polls were released not to convince the public that Vance is doing well, but to convince <em>Vance</em> that his campaign needs to step it up.) Same with Mandel, whose own campaign’s polling staked him to an even bigger lead <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6096c989138a4a7ae28a2583/t/615130ca2389bb2832f7a74a/1632710859094/Ohio+Senate+Poll.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">back in September</a> (37 percent to Vance’s 13 percent).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">In Ohio, we don’t have a lot of independent polling to validate those internal polls. But when we do, it can be a useful reality check. Take this year’s Republican primary for Texas governor. According to a <a href="https://www.paradigm-llp.com/_files/ugd/2d9332_4cdc2c9131514e6588ee56d58fae71b5.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent poll</a> by Paradigm Partners on behalf of former Texas GOP Chair Allen West’s campaign, West leads incumbent Gov. Greg Abbott, 43 percent to 34 percent. But two independent polls taken around the same time (one from the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/555718826/The-Dallas-Morning-News-University-of-Texas-Tyler-Poll" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Texas at Tyler/Dallas Morning News</a> and one from <a href="https://uh.edu/hobby/election.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouGov/University of Houston</a>) put Abbott way ahead with 58-59 percent, while West is way back at 6-11 percent. That’s such a big disagreement that we reached out to Paradigm Partners to ask more about their methodology, and it turns out there’s a reason their poll is such a big outlier: While most polls are weighted to ensure they are demographically representative of the electorate, their survey was completely unweighted. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">So you can see why it’s a problem that internal polls are such a large share of the primary polling data we have so far. And in fact, that problem may be understated. While we did our best to identify every internal poll so far this cycle, that “118” number is almost certainly an undercount. Just because we didn’t mark a poll as internal doesn’t mean it’s truly independent and unbiased. For instance, according to the New York Post, this <a href="https://nypost.com/2021/11/28/hochul-holds-solid-lead-over-james-in-ny-governor-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In the Field Global poll</a> of the Democratic primary for governor of New York was paid for by an unknown “moderate political group” — hardly an uninterested actor in a race that looks like it will be another proxy war between Democrats’ moderate and progressive wings. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the more unusual cases we identified is a quartet of <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21196588-ohio-poll-toplines-222?responsive=1&amp;title=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Public Policy Polling</a> surveys of <a href="https://www.marylandmatters.org/2022/02/03/poll-trumps-endorsement-could-sway-gop-voters-toward-cox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Republican primaries</a> sponsored by the <em>Democratic</em> Governors Association. These aren’t internal polls because the DGA certainly isn’t endorsing GOP candidates — but they’re clearly not independent polls either. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If anything, their purpose is probably to sow mischief in GOP primaries, with the hope that it will help Democrats in the general election. For instance, back in October, the DGA released a <a href="https://democraticgovernors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/DGA-Polling-Memo-Status-of-the-MA-GOP-Primary.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">poll</a> of the Republican primary for governor of Massachusetts showing that conservative former state Rep. Geoff Diehl led moderate Gov. Charlie Baker, 50 percent to 29 percent. That poll may have contributed to doubt that Baker could win the primary, which in turn may have contributed to Baker’s <a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2021/12/01/metro/baker-telling-allies-he-isnt-running-reelection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">December decision to retire</a>. (Though to be clear, Baker almost certainly conducted his own polling and analysis to inform that decision.) Regardless, though, that decision rocketed Massachusetts to the top of the list of <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/36-states-are-electing-governors-this-year-here-are-the-races-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">governorships most likely to flip in 2022</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in November, the DGA also sponsored a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dvrzSIZ8TJrIoGanRopkOzBbjR-mFv4v/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a> of the GOP gubernatorial primary in Pennsylvania — the results of which promoted a narrative that there is <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pennsylvania-republican-party-senate-governor-endorsement-20220205.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no clear front-runner</a> and that that could lead to the nomination of far-right state Sen. Doug Mastriano, who <a href="https://www.witf.org/2021/05/28/pa-sen-doug-mastriano-unlikely-to-face-consequences-over-newly-released-jan-6-videos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">participated in the Jan. 6 insurrection</a> at the U.S. Capitol. Mastriano took 18 percent in the survey, more than any other candidate. And in the absence of more recent polling of the race, we have no independent confirmation of how close that result is to reality.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Clearly, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of internal polls — and even some non-internal polls. But unfortunately, they’re most of the data that we currently have for 2022 primaries, so sometimes using them is unavoidable. That’s OK as long as you do so with your eyes open to the fact that they are trying to sell you an agenda. And once you factor in that agenda, sometimes internal polls can tell you something interesting after all — if not about the actual state of the race, then about what one of the actors in that race wants you to think.</p>



<h2 id="other-polling-bites"><strong>Other polling bites</strong></h2>



<ul><li>A majority of Americans (62 percent) <a href="https://www.prri.org/research/welcoming-immigration-policies-remain-popular-but-immigration-is-not-a-critical-issue-for-most-americans/">backed a pathway to citizenship</a> for undocumented immigrants and believed more broadly that immigrants strengthen American society (56 percent), according to a recently published survey from the Public Religion Research Institute, conducted last September. But even though a majority of Americans from most religious backgrounds that PRRI surveyed supported creating a pathway to citizenship — with Black Protestants most in favor, at 75 percent — there was one notable exception: White evangelical Protestants were the least likely (47 percent) to support a pathway to citizenship. </li><li>The share of Americans extremely satisfied with their romantic relationship <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_020722/">dropped by 10 percentage points</a> since a year ago, according to a Jan. 20-24 poll from Monmouth University. But divorce lawyers shouldn’t get too excited: Majorities were still extremely satisfied with their relationship (60 percent) and felt that their partner is extremely important to their happiness (54 percent). In fact, the decline in relationship satisfaction puts the current number within the range of pre-pandemic figures, after an 11-point rise in Monmouth’s May 2020 survey.</li><li>On that romantic note, Americans aren’t enthused by Valentine’s Day. Fifty-eight percent of adults said that Valentine’s Day is not a “<a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/lifestyle/articles-reports/2022/02/08/valentines-day-ranks-behind-major-holidays">real special occasion</a>,” according to a Jan. 27-31 poll from YouGov. Of the nine other holidays YouGov asked about, Americans preferred every one of them more than Valentine’s Day. Christmas was the most popular, leading Valentine’s Day by 69 points, and Americans even preferred the second-least-popular holiday, Labor Day, over Valentine’s Day by 8 points.</li><li>Twelve percent of registered voters ranked “division in the country” as <a href="https://politics.georgetown.edu/2022/02/03/battleground-civility-poll-voters-agree-politics-has-grown-less-civil-since-covid-19-and-beginning-of-biden-presidency/">the most important issue facing America</a>, just narrowly behind the rising cost of living (13 percent), according to a Jan. 22-27 poll conducted by Lake Research Partners and The Tarrance Group for Georgetown University’s Institute of Politics and Public Service. Two-thirds of voters said that the pandemic had led to politics getting worse, while 58 percent felt that the Jan. 6 Capitol attack had made violent political protests more likely to happen in the future. In total, 43 percent said that politics had become less civil during Biden’s presidency.</li><li>Fewer Americans believe that Trump <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2022/02/08/fewer-americans-now-say-trump-bears-a-lot-of-responsibility-for-the-jan-6-riot/">bears “some” or “a lot” of responsibility</a> for the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, according to a Jan. 10-17 poll from the Pew Research Center. The share of Americans assigning blame to Trump declined from 75 percent in January 2021 to 67 percent in January 2022. This change resulted from a smaller share of Americans (43 percent this January, compared with 52 percent last January) saying Trump bore “a lot” of responsibility, while the share assigning him “some” responsibility was nearly identical.</li></ul><h2 id="biden-approval"><strong>Biden approval</strong></h2>

In fact, they say, the kinds of partisans who are engaged enough to actually despise the other side only make up 15-20 percent of the country. The other 80 percent or so are focused on their daily lives and, in large part, don’t like politics or want to talk about them.

<p data-paragraph="main">How to go about building a Super Bowl team? That’s the question 32 front offices ask themselves every NFL offseason — and almost all of them land on the incorrect answer, for one reason or another. The two clubs that get it right, meanwhile, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/theres-more-than-one-way-to-build-a-super-bowl-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">usually offer variations on a theme</a> for the rest of the league to copy. But we may never have seen two teams <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cincinnati-bengals-los-angeles-rams-super-bowl-11644129467" target="_blank" rel="noopener">take such radically different paths</a> to Super Bowl Sunday — or offer such different lessons in how to reach the cusp of a championship — as the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Rams this season.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And that variety is a good thing for football. A <a href="https://twitter.com/DKThomp/status/1391827053868105739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">common refrain from other sports</a> is that they’ve become too homogenized in their dominant strategies, whether it involves the rise of <a href="https://www.mlb.com/glossary/idioms/three-true-outcomes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three true outcome</a>-based rosters in baseball or <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-mapping-shots-in-the-nba-changed-it-forever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3-point-shooting teams</a> in basketball. The NFL has its own <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/33253649/commissioner-roger-goodell-says-nfl-fell-short-hiring-minority-head-coaches" target="_blank" rel="noopener">massive homogeneity problems</a>, to be sure, but there’s less to complain about when it comes to teams all building the same way. Cincinnati and L.A. are the only two teams whose championship hopes have not yet been dashed, but how they got here is a study in contrasts.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Cincinnati’s rise this season was meteoric. Though <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/our-2021-nfl-projections-like-the-bucs-and-chiefs-again/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we called the Bengals</a> “an intriguing pick to improve greatly” in our NFL preview, they also started out ranked just 27th in our preseason <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elo ratings</a>, with only a 1 percent chance to win the Super Bowl. Only one eventual Super Bowl team — the 1999 “<a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/revisiting-the-greatest-show-on-turf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greatest Show on Turf</a>” (St. Louis) Rams — ever began a season ranked lower in Elo than Cincy did this year:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">By Week 7, when the Bengals <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202110240rav.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demolished the Ravens 41-17</a> in Baltimore, it was becoming clear that Cincinnati had the potential to vastly exceed its meager preseason expectations. But after rising to No. 12 in Elo with that victory, Cincy hit a snag — losing four of its next six contests to drop back down to No. 22 in Elo. That’s when the Bengals went on another tear, winning six of seven to close the regular season and begin the playoffs — the lone blemish being a start by backup quarterback Brandon Allen <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201090cle.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in Week 18</a>. After an <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/we-finally-have-a-super-bowl-matchup-and-its-exactly-what-we-expected/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressive upset comeback</a> against the Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati now ranks seventh in Elo, a 20-slot improvement on its Week 1 ranking.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Bengals’ journey is a testament to the power of building with young talent through the draft. The team took <a href="http://pfref.com/pi/share/bptXt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four of its five best offensive players</a> this season by <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/blog/approximate-value-methodology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Approximate Value</a> (AV) — QB Joe Burrow (15 AV), receivers Ja’Marr Chase (13) and Tee Higgins (10) and lineman Jonah Williams (9) — with picks in the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/draft.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 33 slots of each of the past three drafts</a>. Expanding the scope of things slightly, nearly 75 percent of the Bengals’ total yards from scrimmage this season were gained by players Cincinnati selected over the past five drafts (a list that includes <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cin/2021.htm#rushing_and_receiving::7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leading rusher Joe Mixon</a> as well). That’s a perfect recipe for a great young core, if not necessarily an experienced one. In terms of average age and previous career AV — weighted by the amount of AV each player produced during the season itself — the Bengals have both the youngest and the least-established roster of any team in Super Bowl history:</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">That youth could serve the Bengals well for a while; a number of clubs on that list went on to contend beyond just their initial Super Bowl run. Win or lose, Cincinnati could be set up for lasting success based on the youth movement that has helped it reach this Super Bowl.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And the success of the Bengals’ young stars this year ended up being key to their master rebuilding plan. Because so many of the team’s best offensive players make comparatively little money — Burrow, Chase, Higgins and Williams <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cincinnati-bengals/contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earn a combined average annual value</a> (AAV) of $23.3 million, or just under 13 percent <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nfl-2021-salary-cap-182-5-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener">of the salary cap</a>, while producing nearly 21 percent of the team’s AV — Cincinnati could maintain one of the league’s <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/#passing::21" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most efficient passing offenses</a> despite committing the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2021/offense/active-aav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12th-fewest dollars of AAV to offense</a> of any team. In turn, that enabled Cincinnati to increase its spending on defense from the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2020/defense/active-aav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-fewest AAV dollars</a> in 2020 to the <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/positional/2021/defense/active-aav/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10th-most in 2021</a>, and see its defensive performance improve from No. 25 in schedule-adjusted <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/8379024/nfl-explaining-expected-points-metric" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected points added (EPA)</a> per game to No. 11. All of that, combined with the stellar play of its special teams corps (No. 3 in EPA), added up to make Cincinnati an unlikely — but far from illogical — AFC champion.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">In many ways, the Rams took a completely opposite path to the Super Bowl. If little had been expected of Cincinnati coming into 2021, Los Angeles’s expectations were sky-high — pressure ratcheted up further by the <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/matthew-stafford-gave-the-rams-a-shot-at-a-title-the-rams-gave-stafford-a-shot-at-canton/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offseason acquisition of QB Matthew Stafford</a> to help push a star-studded roster over the top. L.A. <a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2021-nfl-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ranked sixth in Elo</a> before the season, and it mostly played to that form all year long: After starting off like a team on a mission, winning seven of their first eight contests, the Rams suffered their only losing streak of the year at midseason but recovered by winning eight of nine across the end of the regular season and into the playoffs. Along the way, the Rams <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201230tam.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knocked out</a> the defending-champion Tampa Bay Buccaneers — <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/tom-brady-retires-with-all-the-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ending Tom Brady’s career</a> — and even <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/202201300ram.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">vanquished their rival San Francisco 49ers</a>, who had beaten them twice during the regular season and <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-to-watch-for-in-the-nfls-conference-championships/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seemed to pose the biggest matchup challenge</a> to L.A.’s preferred style of play.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And in stark contrast with the Bengals’ plan to build around highly drafted young talent, the Rams have famously <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-love-trading-early-draft-picks-how-much-value-do-they-find-in-the-later-rounds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eschewed high draft picks</a> with a focus instead on building around established big names and hunting for late-round bargains. While Los Angeles’s <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-the-bengals-slow-down-aaron-donald-nothings-stopped-him-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most important player</a> — defensive lineman Aaron Donald — was selected by the Rams <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2014_draft.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a first-round pick</a> in 2014, essentially <a href="http://pfref.com/pi/share/VxGT4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">none of L.A.’s other contributors</a> were taken by the team with a high pick. To the extent the Rams have any highly drafted players, they are stars like Stafford, cornerback Jalen Ramsey, linebackers Von Miller and Leonard Floyd and receiver Odell Beckham Jr. — all of whom were drafted by <em>other</em> teams and joined the Rams later.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That has helped give Los Angeles one of the least-homegrown cast of characters to ever reach a Super Bowl, with 40.8 percent of the team’s total AV coming from players who did not make their NFL debuts as Rams. While not quite as extreme as a team like the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/rai/2002.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2002 Oakland Raiders</a> — for whom a stunning 56.3 percent of AV came from players drafted outside the organization — the Rams’ number still ranks them 13th out of the 112 teams in Super Bowl history, well above the all-time Super Bowl average of 25 percent for non-homegrown production.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="27" href="#fn-27" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And a far cry from the days of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/pit/1979.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;1979 Pittsburgh Steelers&lt;/a&gt;, who somehow received 100 percent of their production from homegrown players &mdash; which still makes them the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.steelers.com/news/asked-and-answered-nov-22-x4512&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;only entirely homegrown roster&lt;/a&gt; in Super Bowl history (a distinction they will likely always carry, as player movement is far greater in the NFL today than it was then).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-27">27</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The strategy has also brought plenty of roster churn since the last time the Rams were on the championship stage, even though it’s been only four seasons since Los Angeles <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-rams-really-made-a-mess-of-super-bowl-liii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fell to the New England Patriots</a> in Super Bowl LIII. Compared with that team, L.A. in 2021 has a brand-new leading passer (Stafford instead of Jared Goff), leading rusher (Sony Michel, who was actually on the Patriots in 2018, instead of Todd Gurley), leading tackler (safety Jordan Fuller — who <a href="https://twitter.com/JourdanRodrigue/status/1480692266909847554" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suffered a season-ending injury</a> in Week 18 — instead of linebacker Cory Littleton) and only six total starters in common.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="28" href="#fn-28" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defining &ldquo;starter&rdquo; as a player who started at least eight games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-28">28</sup></a> Overall, this year’s Rams roster received only 33.9 percent of its AV from players who had been on the 2018 Super Bowl team — so tear up your programs from February 2019 if you’re looking for a who’s who of L.A. stars.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, Los Angeles has impressively executed its grand, unconventional team-building strategy. The Rams have found <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/ram/2021_roster.htm#roster::5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a number of starters</a> with picks in the second round or later — headlined by the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2017/draft.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 third-round selection</a> of <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2021/allpro.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All-Pro wideout</a> Cooper Kupp, who just hauled in the <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/rec_yds_single_season.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second-most receiving yards in a single season</a> in NFL history. They also hit on most of their “<a href="https://www.newsday.com/sports/columnists/bob-glauber/super-bowl-rams-bengals-1.50500466" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mercenary</a>” veteran acquisitions, with Stafford, Miller, Ramsey, Floyd and Beckham all playing significant roles in the team’s postseason run.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="29" href="#fn-29" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each has played at least 72 percent of available snaps in the playoffs on their side of the ball, according to ESPN&rsquo;s Stats &amp;amp; Information Group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-29">29</sup></a> The resulting group has a top-heavy quality; six Rams <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/los-angeles-rams/contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have a higher contract AAV</a> than Cincinnati’s <a href="https://www.spotrac.com/nfl/cincinnati-bengals/contracts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highest-paid player</a> (defensive end Trey Hendrickson at $15 million), but L.A. also has only five players making between $2 million and $15 million. (Cincinnati has 14.) While it’s not quite a full <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/paine-out-of-sample-war.png?w=610" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“stars-and-scrubs” model</a> of putting together a team, because L.A. has scrounged for genuine contributors up and down the roster, it’s a very different type of club than the one lining up on the opposite sideline Sunday.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But despite the radically different paths each team took to get here, the Bengals and Rams did both end up in the same place. Along the way, they proved once again that there is no shortage of approaches that can lead you to winning football games.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main"><em>The COVID-19 pandemic has brought up tons of data questions — what information should we be collecting, what can it tell us (and what does it fail to tell us) and how should the data we use to make decisions be communicated to the public? We’ve started a new series, “COVID Convos,” that brings these questions to the forefront through interviews with the scientists and practitioners who produce and use data on COVID-19.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><em>Each conversation will be a chance for a different scientist to highlight a dataset or data question they think is particularly important and tell us why. This edition features a conversation with </em><a href="https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-people/nuzzo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Jennifer Nuzzo</em></a><em>, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, which was conducted on February 2. Our discussion, which has been condensed and lightly edited, focused on the “test positivity” metric that seems to be everywhere during a COVID surge, and what it can and can’t tell us.</em></p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>Today, we&#8217;re talking about test positivity calculations and how they’re used and misused. I want to start things off by reminding all of our readers &#8212; and maybe myself &#8212; of what exactly test positivity rates even are.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo:</strong> When we started tracking test positivity, we did so exclusively to answer the question, &#8220;Are we testing enough?” If you remember back to the beginning of the pandemic, there were all these stories about how many thousands of tests we were doing per day. There were all these proposals out there for how many tests the United States needed to be doing. And they literally ranged from the tens of thousands to the tens of millions. And we were like, “Well, which one is it?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The more my colleagues and I thought about it, we realized that the amount of testing we would have to do would change based on how many infections we think are current. The closest that we could come to getting at that (with the data that were available at the time) was positivity. Initially, the only thing we could do was to look at the number of positive cases versus the number of tests. And we just looked at that ratio.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It became clear that the positivity rate was better than counting the numbers of tests because there are places like Taiwan where the number of tests they were doing was very low, but they also, for a long period of time, had under 500 total cases. At some point, you run out of people to reasonably test if your prevalence of infection is so low. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Really this was to answer the question, “Are we testing enough?” &#8212; not to do a backdoor calculation of prevalence, because you can get a different positivity rate depending on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/02/nyregion/coronavirus-orange-county-new-york.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">who you test</a>. And at various points in the pandemic, the people who were getting tested were different. They still are. Positivity, unfortunately, became misinterpreted as a proxy for prevalence, but it never was. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth:</strong> What do you mean that the people who were getting tested are changing?&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo: </strong>If we only test the people who are really sick &#8212; say, the people who are showing up at hospitals that require admission &#8212; we&#8217;re going to have a very high positivity because the probability that those people have this virus is very high. We saw that in New York City in the early days when we were looking at their test positivity, where it was <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states/new-york" target="_blank" rel="noopener">close to 50 percent</a>. Now, at that point, it wasn&#8217;t that 50 percent of the population was infected, it was just that you had to be really darn sick in order to get a test in New York City. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>You said that there are multiple ways to calculate the test positivity rate. Can you talk about that a little bit?&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo:</strong> So <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/lab/resources/calculating-percent-positivity.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the CDC has offered three different ways</a>. And they&#8217;re all imperfect. You could do…&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">1.) Of the number of PCR <em>tests</em> that you have done on a given day, what percentage is coming back positive? (That&#8217;s probably a fairly straightforward calculation.)</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">2.) The number of <em>people</em> who tested positive in a day compared to the number of <em>tests</em> performed. (Now anyone who&#8217;s mathematically minded would say, that seems weird because you have a unit in the numerator that&#8217;s different than the unit in the denominator. The reality is that may be the only data that is available.) Or… </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">3.) Of the <em>people</em> who were tested today, how many of them tested positive.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, at the beginning, we were very interested in that third category because testing was so constrained that hardly anybody was able to get tested. And the people who were getting tested were largely people in the hospital. And those people were getting repeat tested a lot. You really only care about the time when they turned positive; you don&#8217;t care about the subsequent positives. And so those repeat tests, from a public health perspective, don&#8217;t tell us much.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now, though, testing has changed. We do testing for other reasons, including screening tests by employers. So the reality is you want to know all of those metrics and calculations, in part because they each tell you something different. The challenge is that the data states report is literally all over the place. You basically can&#8217;t get a <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/tracker/positivity-comparison" target="_blank" rel="noopener">single calculation for every single state</a> that is a pure apples-to-apples comparison. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>Why do we keep making <a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#county-view?list_select_state=all_states&amp;list_select_county=all_counties&amp;data-type=Risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these national</a> and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/positive-rate-daily-smoothed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">international maps</a> of positivity rates, then?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo:</strong> Well, I think it&#8217;s important to get a snapshot of where generally we are, even if it&#8217;s imperfect. This is a national crisis. So we need a national map. But you shouldn&#8217;t in any way tie high-consequence decisions to any particular metric, particularly if you don&#8217;t acknowledge its flaws. And one of the things that we saw was that states like New York were using positivity metrics from different states as the basis for <a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/coronavirus/cuomo-ditches-quarantine-list-for-sweeping-ny-entry-test-policy/2697913/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">putting states on interstate quarantine lists</a>. If we had standardized data for all 50 states, and if we were consistently testing approximately the same populations, that would be telling us something different, but that&#8217;s not what we have right now.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">What we are trying to understand is how wide of a net are we casting to find infections and count them as cases. It helps us interpret our case numbers. It helps us try to understand what we&#8217;re likely missing and which communities may not be as well-served as others. And my frustration is that it&#8217;s never been used as the operational metric it&#8217;s meant to be. If you see positivity in an area that&#8217;s high, the first instinct is to ask how can we go out and blanket areas that may be in greater need with testing? </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the very few states that track testing with respect to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/data/racial-data-transparency" target="_blank" rel="noopener">race and ethnicity</a>, we looked at the number of tests done per case in different racial and ethnic groups. And we did this because we know that there are disparities in representation among cases. There are disparities in representation among who gets hospitalized and who dies from this virus. So the question is, “Well, are there disparities and how wide of a net are we casting to find infections in these different racial and ethnic groups?” </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And, unsurprisingly, there are. In Latinx populations, we’ve found there are fewer tests per case performed than compared to other racial and ethnic groups. What that tells us is that we are missing an opportunity to identify infections in these communities, so that people can know their status and try to protect their loved ones. We&#8217;re missing opportunities to connect infected people to care that could potentially save their lives. Testing is the start of that whole process of managing COVID.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>When we&#8217;re talking about higher positivity rates in African-American communities or Latinx communities, do we know that they actually have higher incidence rates? Or does that reflect that we&#8217;re just not testing those communities that much?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo: </strong>We’re pretty sure from multiple other pieces of data that there has been a disproportionate impact of the disease within BIPOC communities. But it’s also likely that lower access to testing has contributed to the spread by making it harder to connect people to care.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>So it sounds like we have gotten into this place where we see a high positivity rate and the reaction is that we need to institute mitigation controls by reducing the number of people who are getting COVID. But what we should be doing is testing more.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo: </strong>Part of how we mitigate is by casting a wider net to find infections so that we can stop transmission chains. And that&#8217;s the piece that&#8217;s always been missing. If I saw test positivity in an area go up I would say, “Why is it going up? Is it that the asymptomatic people are not showing up to get tested? Are people increasingly not wanting to get tested? Are they unable to get tested for some reason?”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I would want to go and make sure that community has access to masks so they can protect themselves at home, that they know how to access care if they need it. And, of course, we want to bring the infections down, but it also starts with knowing who&#8217;s infected.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth</strong><strong>:</strong> Scientists like your team introduced test positivity as a metric for whether we&#8217;re testing enough. How did it become the metric that we track transmission with?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo:</strong> Well, it&#8217;s used that way in other infections. Take the flu, for instance: We often talk about test positivity, but we don&#8217;t see flu testing quite as dynamic as COVID testing has been. We don&#8217;t usually test people without symptoms or particular epidemiologic reasons to think they&#8217;re infected.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>So it&#8217;s not necessarily a bad way to use the metric in a broad sense, but it&#8217;s not working here.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo:</strong> Yeah. If the positivity goes up, that tells me something&#8217;s happening, that makes me worried. I think it&#8217;s likely due to increased infections. But I also look at the denominator, right? I&#8217;m trying to see what&#8217;s contributing to that change. How much is the numerator going up versus the denominator? Epidemiologists rarely look at one metric; we always look at multiple and we try to see if there are signals because our data is always imperfect. And that doesn&#8217;t mean it’s not useful. It just means that you have to do more triangulation than people may appreciate. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>So is there a metric that we should be using to compare transmission rates?&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo:</strong> I think you have to use multiple things. And I think the fairest comparison is to compare a state to itself or a country to itself over time and to try to understand what is driving those changes.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Now we&#8217;re in this problem where our infection prevalence has gone up so incredibly high with omicron and testing has been so incredibly constrained, and our very, very imperfect back of the envelope calculation of national test positivity, <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/testing/individual-states" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over 20 percent</a> &#8212; really high. That positivity rate is all the people who showed up at testing sites somewhere. That&#8217;s not all the people who tested themselves at home. And we know that a lot of people are testing themselves at home these days because it&#8217;s literally the only option. So now we&#8217;re at yet another juncture where we&#8217;re saying, “Okay, well, what is our testing data telling us?” It&#8217;s different now than it was a year ago. It represents a different population.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We do not have a way to calculate positivity rate exactly the same way for all 50 states using their own data. States report data to the CDC, which allows the organization to show a single positivity calculation, but we’ve found variation between these numbers and what the states show on their own dashboards, probably because they are showing different calculations. At the best, it can lead to confusion. And yet we think it is absolutely important in a national crisis that we have a 50-state calculation because we need to know whether we as a country doing better or worse. So the alternative is not to just not use data, it&#8217;s to use data, but be very mindful of the ways in which it&#8217;s flawed and what you can and cannot tell for sure from the data.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>Are there any steps that state governments or the federal government could be taking right now, at this point in the pandemic, to make this metric work better?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo:</strong><strong> </strong>Yeah, I mean, I still think it&#8217;s not too late for data standards, telling states how best to use testing at this point. I don&#8217;t think that we&#8217;re going to continue this level of testing forever. But there is more strategic testing that we could do to answer questions like, “What is the prevalence of infection?” That&#8217;s hard to discern when you just have a passive collection system (what we have), which is where you make tests available and you hope that people avail themselves of it. If you really want to answer that question, you sample strategically to try to get a representative sample.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I would also like to see states making data more available at the local level, because while the national statistics are important for telling us how well the country is doing, you want hyperlocal numbers to know for sure what the risk around you is. We don&#8217;t interact with our entire state, we don&#8217;t interact with our entire county, we interact in social networks that are fairly fixed and clustered until we do something like travel across the country for the holidays. So we really need more hyperlocal data to be able to guide our own decision-making about navigating risk. And as we&#8217;re pulling away from state-based interventions, which I think is appropriate, we are effectively starting to leave it up to people to decide for themselves how they want to navigate risk. And we&#8217;ve not equipped people with the information to know what the risk around them is.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Maggie Koerth: </strong>For average people who see test positivity numbers, or even just case numbers for their state &#8212; what should they be taking away from that data? How can you use it in the form that it’s in now?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><strong>Jennifer Nuzzo: </strong>I always encourage people to pay less attention to the number and more attention to the direction of the number. So if the number is going up, that makes me more worried than when it&#8217;s going down. Obviously, if a number is insanely high, like 20 percent, that says a whole lot of people are infected and they don&#8217;t know it. So I use the data to decide whether I&#8217;m gonna wait another month before I take my kids to the aquarium.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">I want to make sure people don&#8217;t take away that the data is bad, so it’s useless. I think the alternative &#8212; using no data &#8212; is not an option. I think it&#8217;s using data, but being very humble about what the data is and what its strengths and weaknesses are and then using that to help you triangulate your way to the truth. </p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Americans <a href="http://www.sca.isr.umich.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are pessimistic</a> about one of the weirdest economies in recent memory, and their negativity is largely due to inflation. The Bureau of Labor Statistics announced today that <a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/cpi.nr0.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prices increased 7.5 percent year-over-year in January 2022</a>, the highest figure since 1982, and as such, more expensive milk, furniture and cars — and the fear that their prices <a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/389129/americans-expect-inflation-persist-next-six-months.aspx?utm_source=alert&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=morelink&amp;utm_campaign=syndication" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will continue to skyrocket</a> — are likely to remain top of mind for Americans. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This, of course, has led to a lot of finger-pointing as to who — or what — is to blame for the price increases we’re seeing. Democrats have <a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-democrats-supply-chain-prices-midterms-f6de1ceb-21a1-469c-a83f-88f48fc07a4b.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blamed supply chain deficiencies</a> due to COVID-19, as well as <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2022/01/10/white-house-inflation-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">large corporations</a> and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/25/business/biden-inflation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monopolies</a>. Republicans, meanwhile, have <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/12/10/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-whats-their-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">attacked</a> President Biden’s legislative agenda, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/republicans-blame-biden-inflation-are-they-right-2021-11-01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claiming that his signature pieces of legislation</a> — most notably the American Rescue Plan featuring $1,400 stimulus checks paid directly to many Americans — are to blame. And to be sure, whether fair or not, <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/most-americans-are-afraid-of-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">most Americans</a> do <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/27/business/economy/biden-economy-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blame Biden</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But what <em>is </em>responsible for inflation in the U.S.? Is it all about the pandemic supply chain, as many Democrats claim, or corporate greed? Or does it have more to do with Biden’s policies, as Republicans have posited?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="inflation-isn-t-just-a-supply-chain-issue-and-the-stimulus-likely-made-it-worse"><strong>Inflation isn’t just a supply-chain issue, and the stimulus likely made it worse</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">One of the Democrats’ most consistent talking points has been that the COVID-19-afflicted supply chain is to blame for our current levels of inflation. Biden has even gone as far as to say that supply chain issues have “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vAqwiD_CH-w" target="_blank" rel="noopener">everything to do</a>” with it, while House Democrats work to craft legislation <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/31/house-democrats-pivot-economy-legislative-win-00003385" target="_blank" rel="noopener">targeted at ameliorating supply chain issues</a>. And <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/opinion/inflation-economy-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many economists</a><a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/12/11/22829221/inflation-rate-cpi-supply-chain-biden-transitory" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> say that <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2022/01/15/omicron-supply-chain-inflation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the foundering supply chain</a> has played a heavy hand in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/10/24/22743104/supply-chain-inflation-shortages-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener">driving up prices</a>, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The thinking goes as follows: Americans stopped using their gym, nail salons and other services as their spending patterns rapidly changed in 2020, and the global supply chain — which <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/22/business/shortages-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already had issues</a> —&nbsp; was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/12/business/inflation-supply-chain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not equipped to deal with the surge</a> in demand for consumer durables (e.g., home workout equipment, office furniture) after the initial global economic shutdown. Combine that rapid demand increase with a shortage in supply, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/article/inflation-definition.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Article&amp;state=default&amp;module=styln-supply-chain&amp;variant=show&amp;region=MAIN_CONTENT_1&amp;block=storyline_top_links_recirc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">you get higher prices</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But at the same time, this Democratic talking point has its limits, as it’s become clear to many economists that American inflation isn’t <em>just</em> a supply chain issue: Our economic response — namely, the trillions of dollars of COVID-19 stimulus paid out over the last 24 months — appears to be <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-13/u-s-inflation-is-starting-to-look-like-a-stimulus-led-outlier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a meaningful differentiator</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A good way to tease this out is to look at Europe, which has faced similar supply chain issues and an even worse oil shock, as it is more dependent on foreign oil <a href="https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=32&amp;t=6#:~:text=How%20much%20oil%20consumed%20by,day%20(b%2Fd)." target="_blank" rel="noopener">than the U.S.</a> And yet, European countries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/02/03/business/ecb-europe-interest-rates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have experienced lower inflation</a>, perhaps due in part to <a href="https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2021/number/4/article/fiscal-stimulus-lessons-from-the-us-to-the-eu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their smaller government response</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Global supply chain problems affect every country in the world, but the United States has had more inflation than other countries,” said <a href="https://economics.harvard.edu/people/jason-furman" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Furman</a>, a professor of economics at Harvard University and chair of the Council of Economic Advisers under former President Barack Obama. “If you look compared to Europe, in the United States goods consumption is higher, and services consumption is higher than what it is [in Europe].”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">One reason for that higher consumption is government spending. In 2020, a divided Congress under former President Donald Trump passed two separate pieces of legislation — first the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/us/politics/coronavirus-house-voting.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$2 trillion CARES Act</a> in March, which <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/04/28/how-many-people-will-get-1200-in-every-state/111604090/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doled out</a> $1,200 checks to most single adults and even more to families, then a $900 billion package <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/12/21/948862052/house-passes-900-billion-coronavirus-relief-bill-ending-months-long-stalemate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in December</a> that, among other aid, issued $600 targeted checks. But then in March 2021, Democrats passed another round of government stimulus in a $1.9 trillion relief package — including $1,400 direct payments to individual Americans — which some experts warned at the time <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/summers-warns-u-s-risks-rising-inflation-amid-massive-stimulus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">might cause inflation</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And it does appear that this most recent round of government spending is at least partially responsible for our current levels of inflation. An October 2021 paper found, for example, that the American Rescue Plan <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/publications/economic-letter/2021/october/is-american-rescue-plan-taking-us-back-to-1960s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">likely made inflation slightly worse</a>, causing significant (but small and fleeting) upward pressure on prices, and many experts have stood by their 2021 assertions that the extra stimulus <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/22/business/economy/inflation-biden-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would lead to inflation</a>. Of course, Biden’s additional stimulus was arguably <a href="https://www.americanprogress.org/article/2021-was-a-year-of-bold-economic-policy-that-must-be-extended/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">necessary for Americans to participate in the economy</a> at the time, and polling <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2021/01/19/most-americans-say-another-round-of-covid-19-economic-relief-will-be-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found widespread support</a> among Americans for more relief. But it has also led <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-target-biden-democrats-over-inflation-what-would-they-do-n1284839" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many Republicans to claim</a> that Biden’s policies are responsible for the historic price increases we’re seeing. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Furman stressed to me that inflation likely would have been high even without a COVID-19 relief bill, however, because of a reopening economy and <a href="https://news.yahoo.com/what-are-base-effects-and-how-do-they-distort-inflation-yahoo-u-113754047.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base effect distortions</a>. Moreover, rising gas prices — one of the most tangible ways in which Americans process inflation — likely have nothing to do with the American Rescue Plan and much more to do with the dynamics of global oil. There is at least some evidence, though, that government spending has caused inflation, beyond the explanation that it’s merely been a supply chain issue.</p>



<h2 id="but-not-all-government-spending-leads-to-inflation"><strong>But not all government spending leads to inflation</strong></h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Critically, however, despite what many Republicans claim, not all government spending has the same effect on inflation. In fact, historically government spending hasn’t usually led to inflation. A <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0014292114001494" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2015 paper</a> in the European Economic Review found, for example, that the effect of government spending on inflation post-World War II was “<a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2016/may/how-does-government-spending-affect-inflation" target="_blank" rel="noopener">not statistically different from zero</a>.” But <a href="https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/dupor/sel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bill Dupor</a>, a co-author of that study and vice president of research at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told me that the size of the intervention matters — and that could help explain why government spending today has spurred inflation but hadn’t in recent memory.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“The big difference, I think, from now relative to that is just the enormity of the government spending,” Dupor said. “That could explain why it wasn&#8217;t finding big effects, while there could be big effects now.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even still, not all government spending the Biden administration has greenlit has likely contributed to inflation. For example, the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Biden signed into law in November is unlikely to have contributed to inflation for a number of reasons. First of all, very <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/09/politics/biden-infrastructure-bill-spending-economy/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">little of it has been paid for</a> at this point. Second, it’s targeted at ramping up the productive capacity of the economy — i.e., investing in new technologies and creating jobs — which means it might <a href="https://www.epi.org/open-letter-from-nobel-laureates-in-support-of-economic-recovery-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">even tamp down inflation</a>. That’s different from the American Rescue Plan, whose $1,400 stimulus checks don’t build up the economy in the same way, according to the economists I spoke with.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Americans, however, aren’t necessarily making this kind of distinction when it comes to government spending. According to a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2022/01/26/biden-poll-social-spending-inflation-00001785" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January Politico-Harvard survey</a>, 43 percent of Americans think that the bipartisan infrastructure bill will increase inflation, while just 10 percent think it will decrease inflation (although 35 percent did say they think inflation will remain unchanged).&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main"><a href="https://www.stern.nyu.edu/faculty/bio/thomas-philippon" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thomas Philippon</a>, a professor of finance at New York University’s Stern School of Business, said that his biggest concern with the recent inflation brought about by the stimulus is that it muddies the waters of government spending in the eyes of voters. That, in turn, Philippon said, expends political capital that can’t be used to tackle other key issues, like infrastructure spending or child poverty.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“People then lump together all kinds of government spending, the good and the bad,” Philippon said.</p>



<h2 id="big-corporations-aren-t-the-biggest-cause-but">Big corporations aren&#8217;t the biggest cause, but …</h2>



<p data-paragraph="main">Finally, some Democrats have singled out big companies and monopolies for their perceived role in driving up prices. Figures across the party’s ideological gamut -— from Sens. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/11/25/inflation-cause-democrats-amplify-nonsense-corporate-greed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bernie Sanders</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/12/1072295047/inflation-is-still-surging-and-some-democrats-see-one-culprit-greedy-companies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elizabeth Warren</a> to Biden — have posited that big businesses, by jacking up their prices in the middle of a pandemic, are to blame for inflation, and that a lack of competition has allowed corporate behemoths to raise their prices unabated.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">At first glance, this explanation appears less plausible than other messaging on inflation. Profit-seeking companies didn’t suddenly become more profit-seeking during the pandemic, nor were they more generous before it. Additionally, corporate concentration has <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/164974/corporate-concentration-inflation-price-gouging" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grown steadily since the 1990s</a> — an era of historically low inflation. <a href="https://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/inflation-market-power-and-price-controls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A January survey of economists</a> at the Initiative on Global Markets at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business found most experts in agreement on both questions: Inflation wasn’t explained by big firms deciding to get richer, and antitrust interventions — such as those tossed about by the Biden administration — weren’t likely to curb inflation.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">However, there is an element of the prices we’re seeing today — and how Americans are responding to them — that could be explained by big business run amok. Philippon, <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237544" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whose book</a> “The Great Reversal” focuses on how a lack of competition and corporate concentration have defined the modern American economy, told me that one reason why inflation is such a big deal in the U.S. is that prices were already so high to begin with.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“That&#8217;s not a statement about rapid inflation, it&#8217;s a statement about slowly rising profit margins that slowly choke off the middle class,” Philippon said. “One reason it&#8217;s particularly painful in the U.S. is that prices were already high, people&#8217;s purchasing power, the real value of their wages was already being eroded by market power before. Then when you add to that a burst of inflation, it&#8217;s even more painful.”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">That may explain why recent polling has found that Americans <a href="https://navigatorresearch.org/most-americans-find-link-between-inflation-and-corporate-greed-convincing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are sympathetic</a> to arguments that attribute inflation to <a href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/01/19/inflation-companies-polling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">corporate greed</a>, and why Biden is singing a fairly populist tune on inflation. But as with all aspects of messaging on the issue, whether Democrats or Republicans are more right on the facts of inflation has very little to do with its potential electoral impact. Prices have to stabilize for Americans to feel good about the economy — and for Democrats to feel good about their chances in 2022. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“I don’t think there’s any message that would make people feel good about 7 percent inflation,” Furman said.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[


<p data-paragraph="main">Dinesh D’Souza can always be counted on to have a bespoke conspiracy theory. In the trailer for his “2,000 Mules” “documentary,” faux static flickers across the screen over footage of what appears to be people voting at ballot drop boxes. A slow, mournful rendition of “The Star-Spangled Banner” plays in the background. And that’s when D’Souza, a pro-Trump conservative personality who was <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/31/us/politics/dinesh-dsouza-facts-history.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pardoned by the former president</a> after being convicted of making illegal campaign contributions, drops the (totally unproven and false) bombshell: Thousands of “mules” stuffed ballot boxes to steal the election for President Biden.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">This is D’Souza’s version of the Big Lie, the unfounded claim that widespread voter fraud plagued the 2020 presidential election and that President Joe Biden’s win was illegitimate. But it is not the only version — the Big Lie means different things to different people.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">A third of Americans — and a majority of Republicans — <a href="https://www.monmouth.edu/polling-institute/reports/monmouthpoll_us_012722/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believe the Big Lie</a>, but the disparate theories include the <a href="https://www.politifact.com/article/2021/oct/15/steve-scalises-flawed-argument-states-didnt-follow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flawed-but-plausible</a>, the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/28/donald-trump-georgia-2020-election-dead-people" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unlikely</a> and the <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/heres-how-hugo-chavez-dead-since-2013-became-responsible-for-trumps-election-loss" target="_blank" rel="noopener">illogical</a>. While no two Big Lie theories are identical in composition, they do share commonality in function. In-depth polling and academic research reveal belief in the Big Lie is incredibly resilient and incredibly influential, swaying <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-big-lie-voting-laws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the creation of new voting laws</a> and shaping <a href="https://www.salon.com/2022/02/07/more-than-80-pro-deniers-are-running-for-key-state-offices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">election campaigns</a> for 2022 and beyond.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There’s a mountain of baseless overlapping claims piled up inside the stultifying biodome of the Big Lie: voters casting multiple ballots, dead people voting, ballot-counting machines flipping votes, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-fact-check-debunking-italy-gate/fact-check-evidence-disproves-claims-of-italian-conspiracy-to-meddle-in-u-s-election-idUSKBN29K2N8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">foreign</a> <a href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/dominion-servers-germany-seized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nations</a> <a href="https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9900544617" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hacking</a> systems to swap totals. The Big Lie is an à la carte conspiracy theory — a bit like QAnon in that respect — where adherents pick and choose what sounds right to them and disregard what doesn’t. Each individual who believes the Big Lie has their own suspicions about what took place, a personal recipe of different conspiracies to nourish their belief that the election was illegitimate. In right-wing chat groups on the messaging app Telegram, these theories are traded as casually as chats about the weather.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“What’s going to be any different this time?!” a user in a QAnon Telegram chat wrote about the midterm elections this past Tuesday evening. “Wait till 3am on election night and lots of mail in ballots and dead people voting.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Brian Cates, a writer for the far-right publication The Epoch Times, was less morbid and more focused on the levers of power when he posted to his nearly 80,000 followers on Telegram earlier this week. “[W]hat happened on election night? Trump was surging to victory. They had to shut everything down and then spent THREE DAYS furiously ginning up enough fake votes to hand Biden the &#8216;win&#8217; on Friday night.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Every iteration of the Big Lie, though, is wrong. The ones in the darkest corner of the Internet? Wrong. The ones brought forward in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/in-depth/news/politics/elections/2021/01/06/trumps-failed-efforts-overturn-election-numbers/4130307001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuits by the Trump campaign</a>? Wrong. The ones already debunked by news sources? Still wrong. There is <a href="https://apnews.com/article/voter-fraud-election-2020-joe-biden-donald-trump-7fcb6f134e528fee8237c7601db3328f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">no evidence of widespread fraud</a> in the 2020 election.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Still, polling gives us a glimpse of the most popular theories on the Big Lie menu. Last summer, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/republicans-belief-voter-fraud-opinion-poll/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a YouGov/CBS News poll</a> asked voters who thought there had been widespread voter fraud and irregularities in the 2020 election exactly what they thought had happened. They were asked about various sources of voting and how much of the voter fraud came from those sources, either “a lot of it,” “some of it” or “hardly any or none.”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Seventy-seven percent said “a lot” of voter fraud and irregularities had come from ballots cast by mail, and 70 percent said a lot of it had come from voting machines or equipment that were manipulated, but just 22 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in person. Racism also appeared to inform a lot of thinking around the Big Lie: 72 percent said a lot of the fraud had come from ballots cast in major cities and urban areas, compared with 22 percent and 14 percent who said a lot of it had come from suburbs and rural areas, respectively. And 39 percent of those who believed voter fraud was widespread said “a lot” of fraud had come from ballots cast in Black communities, while 25 percent said so for white communities and 27 percent said so for voters in Hispanic communities.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The University of Massachusetts Amherst and YouGov <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/toplines-and-crosstabs-december-2021-national-poll-presidential-election-jan-6th-insurrection-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fielded a similar poll</a> in December, asking those who said Biden’s victory was probably or definitely illegitimate to choose from a list of options all the reasons they believed that to be true. In that group, 83 percent said they believed fraudulent ballots had been counted, 81 percent said they believed absentee ballots had been cast using dead people’s identities and 76 percent endorsed the theory that ineligible voters had cast ballots. Just 39 percent said they believed voting machines had been reprogrammed by foreign governments to change ballots from Trump to Biden.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s important to note that people are not just picking everything,” said Alexander Theodoridis, a political science professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst who fielded the survey. “Pure expressive responding would be like, ‘Yeah, everything was wrong with this election. It’s all this stuff.’ Whereas the way they did it suggests they do have at least some critical view of some of these [theories].”&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The idea of expressive responding — the tendency for people to give answers to pollsters that <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-election-meteor/trump-clinton-many-young-americans-prefer-giant-meteor-poll-finds-idUSKCN12I20S" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reflect their feelings</a> or values, but not necessarily their true beliefs — has <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/jan/27/no-america-is-not-on-the-cusp-of-a-civil-war" target="_blank" rel="noopener">been cited</a> as a possible explanation for the high percentage of Republicans in polls who say they believe the election was stolen. Some Republicans, in other words, might <em>say</em> they think the election was stolen when what they really mean is they think the results of the election stink.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Theodoridis has used some polling tools to test how genuine belief in the Big Lie is. <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/01/07/republicans-big-lie-trump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">He and his colleague Lane Cuthbert</a> used <a href="https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/694258" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a research technique</a> meant to reduce expressive responding that went something like this: Survey respondents were divided into two groups, given a list of statements and asked <em>how many</em> of the statements they agreed with, but not which ones. The list of statements were identical, except one group was given an extra statement that the researchers wanted to test on: “Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election was legitimate.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“Basically, if the average person in the control group chooses two out of four items and the average person in the treatment group chooses three out of the five items, you know that the only difference between those averages is the additional fifth item,” Theodoridis said.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Using this method, Theodoridis and Cuthbert found that only 28 percent of Republicans thought that Biden was legitimately elected. In their survey, <a href="https://polsci.umass.edu/sites/default/files/Jan6thAnniversaryCrosstabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">21 percent of Republicans</a> said Biden’s victory was legitimate, and 8 percent said they weren’t sure. Theodoridis said this suggests that the Republicans in the survey were expressing a genuine belief.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But even if some or all of the Americans who say they believe the Big Lie don’t really mean it, the consequences of that expressed belief are very real. A forthcoming study based on a series of daily tracking surveys shows that even when those who believe in the Big Lie are confronted with evidence that counters it, their beliefs don’t waver. Kevin Arceneaux, a political science professor at Sciences Po, and Rory Truex, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton University, teamed up to run tracking surveys of U.S. registered voters from October 2020 through January 2021. As part of the surveys, the pair asked respondents who had identified Trump as the winner of the 2020 election about whether certain scenarios (such as Trump conceding, the Electoral College awarding more votes to Biden or Biden being sworn in) would change their minds. Of those registered voters, 45 percent said they would change their mind if Trump conceded, 31 percent said they would if Biden won the Electoral College, and 38 percent said they would accept the results if Biden was sworn in. But as those events occurred and Arceneaux and Truex continued their survey, belief in the Big Lie remained relatively unchanged.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“It’s not totally surprising — if you ask a hypothetical question, you get a hypothetical answer,” Arceneaux said. “I was surprised how much the aggregate results did not really move in response to actual events that happened.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Arceneaux and Truex’s work revealed that not only is belief in the Big Lie tenacious, it also impacts voters’ views of politicians. When they asked Americans to compare hypothetical political candidates, Republican voters favored candidates who embraced the Big Lie by an average of 5.7 percentage points to candidates who accurately said Trump lost the election. This suggests that the Big Lie is not going anywhere soon and that it will have a meaningful sway on elections. Already we’ve witnessed the Big Lie being <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-jan-6-election-lie/2022/01/05/82f4cad4-6cb6-11ec-974b-d1c6de8b26b0_story.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wielded as a campaign tool</a> by Republican candidates across the country, demonstrating the power of this belief among the party’s voters.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">And as polls continue to capture the millions of Americans who endorse the Big Lie, precisely what they believe matters less than how that belief influences their actions.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Almost four years ago, <a href="https://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2018/02/22/team-usa-womens-hockey-gold-medal-victory-is-most-watched-late-night-show-in-nbcsn-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">3.7 million people</a> watched a hockey game on NBC that ended after 2 a.m. Eastern, bringing an end to a drought that had spanned two decades. The U.S. women’s national team had, on the Olympic stage, finally overcome its rivals to the north for the first time in these players’ careers.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The victory over Canada was a blockbuster moment for the U.S., but those gold medals with the five rings on them tell only a fraction of the story in what is one of the most bitter rivalries in women’s sports. And they leave out crucial stories of the growth of the game outside North America: the tale of Finland’s rise and Sweden’s swift fall, of a young Czech team that has the potential to stand toe to toe with giants. We’ve seen these stories again on display over the course of this Olympic tournament in Beijing, with the quarterfinals <a href="https://olympics.com/beijing-2022/olympic-games/en/results/ice-hockey/event-schedule-women.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">starting late Thursday</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The past three decades of women’s hockey is full of all the drama of a young sport on the rise, both on the ice and off. It features boycotts and contract negotiations, new opportunities and sudden collapses — and yes, gritty battles between the U.S. and Canadian teams.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">From the moment women’s hockey burst onto the international scene in 1990 — in front of 9,000 fans at the inaugural world championships held in Ottawa, Canada — there was an obvious and stark disparity in skill level between the North American teams and their counterparts from the rest of the world. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/23/sports/hockey/23hockey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Future Hockey Hall of Famers</a> such as Canada’s Angela James and the U.S.’s Cammi Granato led their teams in dominating many of their overmatched competitors. This gap would remain something of an abyss over the following nine years, with Canada emerging into the new decade with a +168 goal differential in just 26 international games played (across world championships and Olympics). The only other teams to end the 1990s with a positive number in the goal differential column were the United States (+140) and Finland (+106).</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">We can also use a more advanced, all-in-one metric to show the highs and lows of the sport. <a href="https://twitter.com/DigDeepBSB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Murphy</a> created a women’s college hockey version of <a href="https://hockey-graphs.com/2020/06/25/examining-player-development-in-ncaa-di-womens-hockey-with-game-score-pt-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game score</a>; our version, adapted for international play and limited by the data available, pares his version down somewhat, using goals, assists, shots on goal<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="30" href="#fn-30" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shots on goal data isn’t available until 2000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-30">30</sup></a> and penalty infraction minutes. A country’s game score is the sum of individual player game scores.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">Using Game Score to track the quality of the teams from 1990 on, what we see in that first decade is Canada and the U.S. locked in battle from the beginning, with Finland running a close third. Canada bested the U.S. in <a href="https://www.eurohockey.com/league/915-world-womens-championship.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all five world championships</a> held in the 1990s, but the U.S. did claim the <a href="https://teamusa.usahockey.com/page/show/2908052-1998-nagano-olympic-winter-games-women-s-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inaugural Olympic gold</a> in 1998 at Nagano.</p>

These leagues, while not professional leagues, provided female players with a competitive space to play post-college. Similarly, across the Atlantic, 2007 saw the establishment of the Swedish Women’s Hockey League, or Riksserien, as it was then known. With the world’s second-best league in the world in Scandinavia, and those nations’ elite talent able to compete against one another on a regular basis, nations like Finland and Sweden became increasingly competitive on the international stage. With Finland already putting pressure on them, and Sweden seemingly rapidly catching up, it was a make-or-break time for the USA and Canada with elite players on all four teams going head to head. The major difference was in large part due to the depth of North American rosters and their ability to draw on younger elite players than the Scandinavian nations.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The development of young hockey players also gained a major push this decade when the NCAA national women’s hockey championships became an officially sanctioned event. (The first unofficial national collegiate championship <a href="https://www.powerplays.news/p/the-astonishing-story-behind-the" target="_blank" rel="noopener">took place in 1998</a> and was financed by the United States Olympic Committee in the lead-up to Nagano.) The NCAA women’s hockey program would go on to become the proving ground for many elite female players over the course of the decade: Angela Ruggerio, Jennifer Botterill, Julie Chu and Jessie Vetter — some of the greatest female players to ever play on international ice — were among the winners of the Patty Kazmaier Award, bestowed on the top female player in college hockey each year. The national championship provided the vast majority of North American players with something that simply didn’t exist in Europe or Asia — with the full weight of Title IX aiding these players in their development.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With more playing opportunities and greater development, the skill level in Canada and the U.S. kept rising — borne out by the intense matchups between the two countries. Canada continued its dominance for the first three world championships of the new millennium, though the U.S. bounced back to win three of the final four of the 2000s. In the Olympics, though, Canada rebounded from defeat at Nagano to take the 2002 and 2006 golds — and in Turin, the U.S. didn’t even make the gold-medal game, <a href="https://teamusa.usahockey.com/page/show/2908084-2006-torino-olympic-winter-games-women-s-tournament" target="_blank" rel="noopener">falling to silver medalist Sweden</a>.</p>

It was during this time that the second iteration of the National Women’s Hockey League (now the Premier Hockey Federation) was founded and became <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/nwhl-first-paid-womens-pro-hockey-league-drops-puck-on-first-season/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first league to officially pay female players</a> in any capacity before <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/01/sports/hockey/womens-hockey-league-will-pay-players-for-first-time.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Canadian</a> and Swedish leagues followed suit in subsequent years.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">With increased visibility came increased opportunities for women in the post-collegiate sphere to continue playing longer, with additional support at both a national and team level. But this decade also saw some of the greatest unrest in women’s hockey, with <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/story/_/id/19026627/usa-hockey-us-women-national-team-reach-agreement-avoid-boycott" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boycotts by both the USA</a> and <a href="https://olympics.nbcsports.com/2019/08/16/swedish-womens-hockey-players-boycott-over-pay-dispute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swedish national teams</a> over player compensation, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/31/sports/cwhl-womens-hockey.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shock folding of Canada’s CWHL</a> and the <a href="https://archive.thinkprogress.org/womens-hockey-players-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#forthegame movement</a> in North America.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The decade also brought about some of the sport’s most memorable highlights: the Canadian win on home ice during the 2010 Vancouver Olympics; the “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqBHav5puKA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ping Heard Round the World</a>” in the 2014 Olympic gold medal game, when the USA missed an empty-net goal, hitting the post instead, with just over a minute left. (Canada would go on to equalize 30 seconds later and then win in OT.) The USWNT won the 2017 world championships in overtime just days after reaching an agreement with U.S. Hockey, and then the team won gold for the first time in 20 years at the Pyeongchang Olympics on the anniversary of Miracle on Ice. And that’s not to forget Finland taking silver for the first time in history at the 2019 world championships (though <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/sports/iihf-explains-why-the-goal-that-cost-finland-gold-was-disallowed-1.4380760" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many may argue</a> that it <a href="https://www.theicegarden.com/2019/4/14/18310629/2019-womens-world-championship-iihf-controversy-finland-usa-gold-medal-game-goalie-interference" target="_blank" rel="noopener">should have been gold</a>).</p>

Canada would take home the gold, making up for its first bronze medal in history during the 2019 event and placing the team in an excellent position heading into Beijing.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The under-18 women’s worlds has now been <a href="https://nhl.nbcsports.com/2021/12/24/iihf-cancels-u18-womens-championship-for-2nd-straight-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">canceled two years in a row</a>, but the future of women’s hockey remains bright. Two years’ worth of rookies entering the U.S. and Canadian national systems together have introduced several exciting young stars, some of whom are sure to wear their national flag for at least the remainder of this decade.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Even at this early stage, we have already seen some players’ careers ignite. Sarah Fillier’s performance for Canada at the 2021 world championship shot her toward being a household name. At the same tournament, Grace Zumwinkle stepped out and shone, even among a star-studded U.S. lineup. And Dominika Lásková, who plays for Merrimack College in the NCAA, showed up big for the Czech Republic and was a key contributor to their offensive dominance, <a href="https://www.espn.com/olympics/hockey/story/_/id/32085764/dominika-laskova-scores-twice-czech-republic-beats-germany-win-group-b-women-hockey-worlds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scoring four goals as a defender</a> — something her team will be hoping continues in Beijing. Finland, which is the biggest threat to the U.S. and Canada’s hold on the gold-medal game, saw goaltender Anni Keisala step up big at the worlds, all but cementing her position as the team’s starting goaltender and last line of defense. In the U.S. and Canada’s group play matchup in Beijing, Abby Roque emerged as a force for Team USA with an almost perfect faceoff record against the Canadians, and while she is still goal-less in the tournament, it feels like only a matter of time. Similarly, Fillier continues to defy even the loftiest of expectations, scoring on her opening shift in two straight games. And if the two teams, entering the semifinals seeded first and second, meet again in the Olympics, it will be in the gold-medal game. </p>



<p data-paragraph="main">The Olympics still stands taller than any other international tournament as the ultimate measure of not just a player’s skill but a country’s might — and for the first time in history, it might not be just a two-horse race this winter. While their lineups may be made of Titans of the Sport in players like Marie-Philip Poulin, Mélodie Daoust, Hilary Knight and Kendall Coyne Schofield, Canada and the United States are not invincible, and they can be beaten — Finland’s near-win in 2019 showed that. Other countries now boast stars comparable to those in North America: Finland has arguably the best defender in the world in Jenni Hiirikoski; Alina Müller, who <a href="http://reports.iihf.hockey/Hydra/436/IHW400000_85B_22_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">led the last Olympics in goals</a>, plays for Switzerland; Nana Fujimoto has the ability to completely lock down the goal crease for Japan, letting nothing past; and the Czech Republic might be the most fun team to watch.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">There may never have been a better time to get invested in women’s hockey. This tournament houses a rivalry that runs deep into the hearts of two nations, that makes a gold-medal game that finishes after 2 a.m. worth staying up for in the eyes of millions. It’s a chance to experience moments that will no doubt go down in hockey’s rich history.</p>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-paragraph="main">Despite all the high-profile mercenaries the Los Angeles Rams acquired during their run to Super Bowl LVI, the single biggest difference-maker is one they drafted in 2014: Aaron Donald. He’s not just the best at what he does, he’s the most impactful individual defender on the planet — and the Cincinnati Bengals’ offensive line might not be able to slow him down.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Donald’s credentials are impeccable. Aside from making the Pro Bowl in every one of his <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DonaAa00.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">eight professional seasons</a> and being named first-team All-Pro seven years running, he’s won AP Defensive Player of the Year <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/awards/ap-defensive-player-of-the-year.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">three of the last four seasons</a>. His tape backs up all the hardware, too; Pro Football Focus graded him as its best pass-rushing defensive lineman, fourth-best run-stopping defensive lineman and No. 1 overall defensive player of 2021.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="31" href="#fn-31" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donald was also Pro Football Focus&rsquo;s top-graded defender in 2020, 2019, 2018, 2017 and 2016, among those with at least 20 percent of the league-maximum defensive snaps. In 2015, he finished second-highest, and his rookie year he tied for eighth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-31">31</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Donald doesn’t just pass the eye test, either. His 12.5 regular-season sacks tied for seventh-most in the NFL, and according to ESPN’s Stats &amp; Information Group, his 84 tackles from the defensive line ranked third. He ranked second among all front-seven defenders in pass rush win rate and tied for eighth in disrupted dropback rate.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="32" href="#fn-32" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dropback rate is the player&rsquo;s total of sacks, interceptions, batted passes and passes defensed, divided by opponent dropbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-32">32</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But ESPN’s Video Analysis Team saw Donald generate pressure on only 10.5 percent of his pass rushes​​, good for 22nd in the league.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="33" href="#fn-33" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among players whose pass rushes are at least 10 times the number of their team&rsquo;s games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-33">33</sup></a> That’s just 0.1 percentage points more than new Ram Von Miller and 1 point less often than their teammate Leonard Floyd. If Donald is beating blockers more often than everyone but Dallas Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons, why is Parsons’s league-best pressure rate almost twice as high (18.3 percent)?</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Teams put a lot more blockers in front of Donald.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“These guys triple-team [Donald],” <a href="https://theramswire.usatoday.com/2021/11/04/rams-von-miller-aaron-donald-cried-tears-joy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Miller told reporters</a> in his introductory press conference. “I’ve been getting triple-teamed for the last 10 years. That’s six people right there. And we still got Leonard Floyd and all the other guys. So, it’s going to be fun.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Opponents aren’t <em>quite</em> committing six blockers to just Donald and Miller. But as an interior lineman, Donald gets double-teamed more often than ends — and far more than stand-up rushers like Parsons and Floyd. Only five defenders faced double-teams more often on pass-rush snaps than Donald, according to ESPN’s Stats &amp; Information Group. Yet nobody beat double-teams more often:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<div class="non-jetpack-embed "><iframe title="Double-teams couldn&#039;t stop Aaron Donald" aria-label="Scatter Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-GpAEk" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/GpAEk/9/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="575"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script></div>
</div></figure>



<p data-paragraph="main">Double-teaming Donald is necessary to slow him down, but it isn’t exactly sufficient. He beat solo blockers a league-high 34.2 percent of the time, and his win rate against double-teams was still a league-best 23.1 percent — the same as Haason Reddick’s eighth-ranked <em>overall</em> rate. As Miller implied, the interior threat presented by Donald limits how often opponents can put more than one body between any other Ram and their quarterback.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">For the Cowboys, Parsons was double-teamed on 21.4 percent of his pass rushes. But Miller faced two opponents on only 7.5 percent of his rushes for the Rams, and Floyd was double-teamed just 11.6 percent of the time. Because Donald was doubled on a whopping 64 percent of his pass-rush snaps, his wingmen on the edge each got to rush one-on-one about nine pass rushes out of 10 — and Donald got through the line more often than anyone but Parsons anyway. No wonder Los Angeles led the league in ESPN’s pass-rush win rate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">It’s a brutal matchup for the Bengals, who have one of the worst offensive lines in football. Their team pass-block win rate was third-lowest in the league this regular season. Pro Football Focus graded Cincinnati as the 25th-ranked pass-blocking team, with grades in the 50s (and below) for every regular contributor save left tackle Jonah Williams.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Center Trey Hopkins has been a recent bright spot, posting pass-protection grades above 70 in four of the past five games — including a 75.3 in the AFC championship game. He’s been asked more regularly to help out platooning right guards Jackson Carman and Hakeem Adeniji, whose pass-blocking grades have been a miserable 45.9 and 38.9, respectively. During this five-game run of good form for Hopkins, he’s blocked in tandem on 85.7 percent of Cincinnati’s dropbacks. That’s not only much higher than his regular-season rate of 81.4 percent, it’s higher than <em>any</em> NFL lineman’s regular-season double-team rate.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But it hasn’t done much good. Though Hopkins’s pass-block win rate over the last five games has improved to 95.8 percent, the Bengals’ team rate was still just 53.1 percent — which, had that been their regular-season number, would have only bumped them up from 30th to 29th. Cincinnati just doesn’t have anybody, or any combination of anybodies, who can keep Donald and company away from quarterback Joe Burrow for very long.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">If Los Angeles wins, three of its hired-gun Pro Bowlers — Matthew Stafford, Odell Beckham Jr. and Eric Weddle — would get their first Super Bowl rings.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="34" href="#fn-34" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller already has one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-34">34</sup></a> But Rams defensive coordinator Raheem Morris said the team is focused on delivering a title to the player who’s been here all this time.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">“This building wants to win for Aaron Donald to create more mystique to his legacy and what he’s done,” <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2022/01/27/raheem-morris-we-want-to-win-for-aaron-donalds-legacy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Morris told the Associated Press</a>. “We want to win for Aaron Donald.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But Donald might win it for them first.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">It didn’t take long after Justice Stephen Breyer <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/supreme-court-justice-stephen-breyer-retire/story?id=74363429" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced his retirement</a> for conservative politicians and pundits to criticize <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/biden-stands-pledge-nominate-black-woman-supreme-court/story?id=82487044" target="_blank" rel="noopener">President Biden’s campaign pledge</a> to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas denounced Biden’s promise as “<a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cruz-joins-republicans-slamming-bidens-vow-black-woman/story?id=82583224" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offensive</a>” while GOP Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/gop-sen-wicker-compares-biden-s-supreme-court-pledge-affirmative-n1288211" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preemptively dismissed</a> the prospective nominee as benefitting from a racially discriminatory “quota.” On Fox News, Sean Hannity <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/hannity-biden-black-female-scotus-pick-identity-politics-steroids-unconstitutional" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slammed</a> Biden’s pledge as “identity politics on steroids.”</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But <a href="https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/reagan-example-republicans-have-conveniently-forgotten-n1288233" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/republicans-fox-news-biden-black-woman-supreme-court-1293781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">astute</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/02/04/1078358077/republicans-take-issue-with-bidens-pledge-to-pick-a-black-woman-for-supreme-cour" target="_blank" rel="noopener">analysts</a> <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/02/biden-supreme-court-nominee-smear-campaign/621408/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promptly</a> <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidents-factored-race-gender-ethnicity-scotus-picks/story?id=82585364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pointed out</a> that Republicans haven’t objected to prior presidents’ pledges to nominate a woman to the Supreme Court. There was no equivalent outcry, for instance, when President Ronald Reagan vowed to appoint <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1980/10/15/reagan-pledges-he-would-name-a-woman-to-the-supreme-court/844817dc-27aa-4f5d-8e4f-0ab3a5e76865/?itid=lk_inline_manual_20&amp;itid=lk_inline_manual_11" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the first woman to the Supreme Court</a> during the 1980 presidential campaign — a promise he fulfilled the following year by nominating Sandra Day O’Connor. Nor was their condemnation of former President Donald Trump’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/sep/20/trump-vows-to-nominate-a-woman-for-us-supreme-court-vacancy-within-a-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pledge</a> to nominate a woman to fill the late Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s seat in September 2020.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">As Stanford professor and FiveThirtyEight contributor, Hakeem Jefferson, <a href="https://twitter.com/hakeemjefferson/status/1487448727870590979" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a>, “Conservatives didn’t get upset when Trump promised to nominate a woman to the bench because the qualifier ‘white’ was simply implied.” He later <a href="https://twitter.com/hakeemjefferson/status/1487841389022879745" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> that it’s the misogynoir, or <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/janicegassam/2020/09/22/misogynoir-the-unique-discrimination-that-black-women-face/?sh=9c858a256ef6" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unique biases Black women experience</a>, not the pledge, that is the problem.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Recent polling data certainly seems to support Jefferson’s argument. Take, for example, Republican responses to the two YouGov polling questions about the importance of nominating a woman and the importance of nominating a <em>Black</em> woman to fill vacated SCOTUS seats in 2020 and 2022, respectively.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">The chart above shows that more than half of Republicans and over three-quarters of Democrats thought it was important to have a female justice replace Ginsburg in a <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/o6p3vjhvnt/20200924_yahoo_coronavirus_tabs.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">September 2020 YouGov/Yahoo Poll</a> conducted a few days before Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett to fill her seat. But while a similarly large share of Democrats said it’s very or somewhat important to have a Black woman replace Breyer in a <a href="https://today.yougov.com/topics/politics/survey-results/daily/2022/01/26/ed5f0/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">January 2022 YouGov survey</a>, only 13 percent of Republicans said the same about Biden nominating a Black woman.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Of course, there are other factors that may be driving Republicans’ divergent responses in that chart besides including the word “Black” before woman in the 2022 polling. Trump’s 2020 nominee, after all, was filling a Supreme Court seat held for over a quarter-century by a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/us/ruth-bader-ginsburg-dead.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">feminist icon</a>, who was only the second woman to ever serve on the high court. That could have easily amplified the importance of nominating a woman more than replacing Breyer, a male justice.<a class="espn-footnote-link" data-footnote-id="35" href="#fn-35" data-footnote-content="&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the January 2022 poll mentions Biden&rsquo;s pledge before asking about the importance of nominating a Black woman; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1540-5907.2011.00541.x&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;political science research&lt;/a&gt; has found that providing such information about the president&rsquo;s positions often increases opposition from the other party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;"><sup id="ss-35">35</sup></a></p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Yet there are good reasons to nonetheless suspect that Republicans are uniquely opposed to presidential pledges in support of African Americans — especially when they’re made by Democratic presidents. In fact, a similar pattern emerged in a <a href="https://doi.roper.center/?doi=10.25940/ROPER-31095452" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2009 CNN/ORC poll</a>, which asked respondents to rate the importance of race and gender in then-President Barack Obama’s forthcoming pick to fill the Supreme Court seat vacated by Justice David Souter’s retirement. Just 14 percent of Republicans said it was important Obama nominate an African American to the Supreme Court.&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">To be sure, <em>both</em> Democrats and Republicans were nearly twice as likely to say it was important for Obama to pick a woman than they were to say it was important for him to nominate an African American to the Supreme Court, as you can see in the chart below. But unlike Democrats who have experienced a sharp uptick in the share who think a Black person should be nominated to the court since 2009, the share of Republicans who agree is practically unchanged.</p>

<p data-paragraph="main">This is yet another reminder of the <a href="https://www.voterstudygroup.org/publication/racing-apart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remarkable shift partisans’ racial attitudes have undergone in the past decade</a>. <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/republicans-and-democrats-increasingly-agree-on-the-protests-but-not-why-people-are-protesting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Several</a> <a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18259865/great-awokening-white-liberals-race-polling-trump-2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surveys</a> <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-2020-could-shape-the-conversation-on-race-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">show</a> that the share of white Democrats who view systemic racism as an impediment to Black progress has skyrocketed in recent years. It’s no surprise, then, that the <a href="https://www.mediaite.com/news/new-polls-most-americans-support-biden-nominating-black-woman-to-supreme-court-but-only-19-percent-of-republicans/https:/www.mediaite.com/news/new-polls-most-americans-support-biden-nominating-black-woman-to-supreme-court-but-only-19-percent-of-republicans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">overwhelming majority of Democrats (82 percent) support</a> “President Biden’s plan to nominate a Black woman to the United States Supreme Court” — especially when Democratic leadership frames the nomination as combatting the same structural biases that have excluded African American women from the high court throughout the nation’s history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">Republicans, meanwhile, have moved in the opposite direction on race. As I wrote in a <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-the-rise-of-white-identity-politics-explains-the-fight-over-critical-race-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previous piece for FiveThirtyEight</a>, GOP politics are increasingly animated by the belief that anti-white discrimination is as big of a problem in American society as biases against racial and ethnic minorities. Those views helped <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/03/03/how-political-science-helps-explain-the-rise-of-trump-the-role-of-white-identity-and-grievances/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fuel Trump’s rise within the party</a>; and they factor heavily into conservatives’ mischaracterization of critical race theory, an academic framework that<a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener"></a> helps explain how <a href="https://www.edweek.org/leadership/what-is-critical-race-theory-and-why-is-it-under-attack/2021/05" target="_blank" rel="noopener">racism permeates American institutions</a>, as an anti-white “<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/annals-of-inquiry/how-a-conservative-activist-invented-the-conflict-over-critical-race-theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener">existential threat to the United States</a>.” <a href="https://docs.cdn.yougov.com/9uqg6clnvr/econTabReport.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Few Trump voters (19 percent) approve</a> of Biden’s pledge — especially when prominent Republicans frame it as a racially discriminatory appointment of an unqualified justice who doesn’t “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7vpey/gop-senator-thinks-bidens-scotus-nominee-wont-know-a-law-book-from-a-j-crew-catalog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know a law book from a J. Crew catalog</a>.” That is, of course, patently false as FiveThirtyEight’s Amelia Thomson-DeVeaux and Elena Mejía wrote in <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-bidens-appointees-can-tell-us-about-his-supreme-court-nominee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent analysis of Biden’s judicial appointees so far</a>.</p>



<p data-paragraph="main">But understanding the power racial grievances have in GOP politics today goes a long way in understanding why Republicans are so strongly opposed to Biden’s pledge to nominate the first Black woman to the Supreme Court. As Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana <a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/playbook/2022/02/02/republicans-cant-agree-on-a-scotus-strategy-00004536" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently said</a>, “I want a nominee who’s not going to try to rewrite the Constitution every other Thursday to try to advance a ‘woke agenda.’” And undoubtedly, the race, gender and partisanship of Biden’s prospective pick all intersect with one another to heighten these Republican fears of “wokeness” run amok in ways that nominees of other identities almost certainly would not.</p>
