The Monetary Authority of Singapore, which holds its scheduled policy reviews only twice a year, surprised markets with the move. The news strengthened the Singapore dollar, one of the world&#8217;s most-traded currencies, to its highest level in three months. The city-state&#8217;s trade-dependent economy is highly susceptible to swings in global inflation and the central bank&#8217;s sudden move comes as price pressures ring alarm bells for policymakers elsewhere in Asia. </p>

Sources told Reuters that the new rules would help developers meet debt obligations and pay suppliers and finance operations by letting them use the funds in escrow that are currently controlled by the municipal governments with no central oversight. Beijing aims to roll out the new rules by as early as the end of January in a push to prevent a wider crisis.</p>

As other countries talk about a transition from &#8220;pandemic&#8221; to &#8220;endemic,&#8221; China has stepped up policies to stamp out any new outbreak as soon as it arises, sealing off cities, shutting transport links and launching mass testing programs.</p>

The slowdown in exports from India, the world&#8217;s biggest rice exporter, has allowed rival suppliers such as Thailand, Myanmar and Vietnam to increase overseas sales at higher prices. Shipments of more than 500,000 tonnes of non-basmati rice that need to be transported to ports on India&#8217;s east coast from the central state of Chhattisgarh have been stuck due to the shortage of freight trains.  </p>
